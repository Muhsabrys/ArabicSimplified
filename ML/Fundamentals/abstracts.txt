BACKGROUND: Mitigation of environmental risk factors for neurocognitive disorders could reduce the number of incident cases. We sought to synthesize the literature on environmental risk factors for dementia and mild cognitive impairment. METHODS: We conducted an umbrella review and meta-analysis. Multiple databases were systematically searched to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of longitudinal studies examining environmental risk factors for dementia or mild cognitive impairment. We used random effects multi-level, meta-analytic models to synthesize risk ratios for each risk factor while accounting for overlap in the studies within reviews. As a secondary objective, we examined risk factors for two common phenotypes of dementia: Alzheimer's disease dementia and vascular dementia. RESULTS: A total of 19 reviews containing 37 meta-analyses were included umbrella review. We found 9 factors where exposure was associated with higher risks of all-cause dementia: fine particulate matter, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, shift work, night shift work, chronic noise, and extremely-low frequency magnetic fields. Neighbourhood greenness was associated with a lower risk of all-cause dementia. In a narrative review, we found that exposure to sulfur dioxide, proximity to roadways, ionizing radiation, aluminum, solvents, pesticides, and environmental tobacco smoke were also associated with dementia. We also found that fine particulate matter, extremely-low frequency magnetic fields, sulfur dioxide, chronic noise, and pesticides were related to Alzheimer's disease dementia. Fine particulate matter, particulate matter, and chronic noise were related to vascular dementia. No systematic review reported on mild cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: Achieving stronger air quality targets has the potential to reduce population-level dementia risk. Neighbourhood (i.e., greenness and chronic noise) and occupational (i.e., shift work) characteristics are associated with dementia and are viable public health intervention points. Additional research should examine the relationship between other environmental risk factors and mild cognitive impairment and specific types of dementia.

Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea, are increasingly implicated as significant contributors to cognitive decline, dementia, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). However, the extent and specificity of these associations remain uncertain. This meta-analysis evaluates the impact of common sleep disorders on the risk of developing dementia and cognitive decline. A comprehensive search of the literature was conducted to identify prospective cohort studies assessing sleep disorders and dementia risk. Studies reporting risk estimates for dementia, AD, or cognitive decline associated with obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, and other sleep disorders (e.g., restless legs syndrome, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, excessive daytime sleepiness) were included. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model to calculate pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Thirty-nine cohort studies were included, with subgroup analyses showing significant associations between all-cause dementia and obstructive sleep apnea (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.09-1.61), insomnia (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.19-1.55), and other sleep disorders (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.24-1.43). Obstructive sleep apnea increased the risk for AD (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.24-1.69), though its association with vascular dementia did not reach statistical significance (HR 1.35, 95% CI 0.99-1.84). Insomnia was significantly associated with increased risk for both vascular dementia (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.01-2.51) and AD (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.27-1.74). This meta-analysis highlights the critical role of sleep disorders in dementia risk, emphasizing the need for early detection and management of sleep disturbances. Targeted interventions could play a pivotal role in reducing dementia risk, particularly among high-risk populations.

Evidence regarding the clinical validity of blood biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the general population is limited. We estimated the hazard and predictive performance of six AD blood biomarkers for incident all-cause and AD dementia-the ratio of amyloid-β 42 to amyloid-β 40 and levels of tau phosphorylated at T217 (p-tau217), tau phosphorylated at T181 (p-tau181), total tau, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-in a cohort of 2,148 dementia-free older adults from Sweden, who were followed for up to 16 years. In multi-adjusted Cox regression models, elevated baseline levels of p-tau181, p-tau217, NfL, and GFAP were associated with a significantly increased hazard for all-cause and AD dementia, displaying a non-linear dose-response relationship. Elevated concentrations of p-tau181, p-tau217, NfL, and GFAP demonstrated strong predictive performance (area under the curve ranging from 70.9% to 82.6%) for 10-year all-cause and AD dementia, with negative predictive values exceeding 90% but low positive predictive values (PPVs). Combining p-tau217 with NfL or GFAP further improved prediction, with PPVs reaching 43%. Our findings suggest that these biomarkers have the potential to rule out impending dementia in community settings, but they might need to be combined with other biological or clinical markers to be used as screening tools.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), exhibit distinct yet overlapping pathological mechanisms. Leveraging large-scale plasma proteomics data from the Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium, we analyzed 10,527 plasma samples (1,936 AD, 525 PD, 163 FTD, 1,638 dementia and 6,265 controls) to identify disease-specific and shared proteins across NDs. We identified 5,187 proteins significantly associated with AD, 3,748 with PD and 2,380 with FTD that revealed both common and divergent proteomic signatures, which were confirmed by multiple analytical approaches and orthogonal validation. PD and FTD showed the highest overlap (r(2) = 0.44) and AD and PD the least (r(2) = 0.04). Immune system, glycolysis, and matrisome-related pathways were enriched across all NDs, while disease-specific pathways included apoptotic processes in AD, endoplasmic reticulum-phagosome impairment in PD and platelet dysregulation in FTD. Network analysis identified key upstream regulators (RPS27A in AD, IRAK4 in PD and MAPK1 in FTD) potentially driving these proteomic changes. These findings reveal distinct and shared mechanisms across NDs, highlighting potential regulatory proteins and pathways for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in neurodegeneration.

Vascular dementia is among the most common etiologies of major neurocognitive disorder (MND), affecting primarily older adults (>65), and it is the leading nondegenerative cause of dementia. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) subsumes all dementing diseases under the syndromic term MND. MND requires an acquired decline in one or more cognitive domains, eg, attention, memory, executive function, language, or visuospatial ability, and a decline in functional independence. Cardiovascular risk factors—smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation—commonly underlie vascular dementia. Diagnosis relies upon a thorough history and physical/neurologic (including mental status) examination. Neuroimaging increases the precision of the diagnosis. Treatment is supportive in the ongoing absence of disease-modifying medications for vascular dementia approved by regulatory bodies.

IMPORTANCE: Recent evidence from a quasi-experiment in Wales showed that herpes zoster (HZ) vaccination appears to prevent or delay dementia. Exploiting a similar quasi-experiment in Australia, this study investigated the effect of HZ vaccination on dementia occurrence in a different population and health system setting. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of HZ vaccination on the probability of receiving a new diagnosis of dementia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In Australia, starting November 1, 2016, live attenuated HZ vaccination was provided free to individuals aged 70 to 79 years through primary care clinicians. Thus, individuals whose 80th birthday was just a few weeks before November 1, 2016, never became eligible, whereas those whose 80th birthday was just a few weeks later were eligible. The key strength of this quasi-experiment is that one would not expect that these comparison groups who differ in age only minutely would, on average, differ in any health characteristics and behaviors. Primary health care records were analyzed with week-of-birth information from 65 general practices across Australia, using a regression discontinuity design. EXPOSURE: Eligibility for HZ vaccination based on date of birth. MAIN OUTCOME: New diagnoses of dementia as recorded in primary care electronic health record data. RESULTS: In this sample of 101 219 patients, 52.7% were women and mean age was 62.6 years (SD, 9.3 years) as of November 1, 2016. Individuals born just before vs just after the date-of-birth eligibility threshold (November 2, 1936) for HZ vaccination were well balanced in their past preventive health services uptake and past chronic disease diagnoses. There was an abrupt increase of 16.4 percentage points (95% CI, 13.2-19.5; P < .001) in the probability of ever receiving HZ vaccination between patients born shortly before vs shortly after the date-of-birth eligibility threshold. The eligibility rules of the HZ vaccination program thus created comparison groups born just on either side of the date-of-birth eligibility threshold who were likely similar to each other, except for a large difference in their probability of receiving the intervention (HZ vaccination) of interest. This study found that eligibility for HZ vaccination (ie, being born shortly after vs shortly before November 2, 1936) decreased the probability of receiving a new dementia diagnosis during 7.4 years by 1.8 percentage points (95% CI, 0.4-3.3 percentage points; P = .01). Being eligible for HZ vaccination did not affect the probability of taking up other preventive health services (including other vaccinations) or the probability of receiving a diagnosis of common chronic conditions other than dementia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: By taking advantage of a quasi-experiment and corroborating findings from Wales in a different population, this study provides evidence of the potential benefits of HZ vaccination for dementia that is more likely to be causal than that of more commonly conducted associational studies.

Dementia is a colloquial term to refer to what is formally called Major Neurocognitive Disorder (MND) as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5th edition (DSM-5). In short, dementia is diagnosed by cognitive decline and a loss of function (decreased ability to perform daily tasks). Many possible etiologies lead to the syndrome of dementia, including Alzheimer dementia, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, and Parkinson disease, among others. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, or BPSD, are neuropsychiatric symptoms that accompany the syndrome of dementia, such as delusions, hallucinations, apathy, anxiety, depression, or disinhibition. BPSD symptoms are prevalent and can significantly impact the prognosis and management of dementia. BPSD includes emotional, perceptual, and behavioral disturbances that are similar to those seen in psychiatric disorders. It may be clinically useful to classify them into 5 domains: cognitive or perceptual (delusions, hallucinations), motor (pacing, wandering, repetitive movements, physical aggression), verbal (yelling, calling out, repetitive speech, verbal aggression), emotional (euphoria, depression, apathy, anxiety, irritability), and vegetative (disturbances in sleep and appetite).

Understanding the lifetime risk of dementia can inform public health planning and improve patient engagement in prevention. Using data from a community-based, prospective cohort study (n = 15,043; 26.9% Black race, 55.1% women and 30.8% with at least one apolipoprotein E4 (APOE ε4) allele), we estimated the lifetime risk of dementia (from age 55 years to 95 years), with mortality treated as a competing event. We applied lifetime risk estimates to US Census projections to evaluate the annual number of incident dementia cases from 2020 to 2060. The lifetime risk of dementia after age 55 years was 42% (95% confidence interval: 41-43). Rates were substantially higher in women, Black adults and APOE ε4 carriers, with lifetime risks ranging from approximately 45% to 60% in these populations. The number of US adults who will develop dementia each year was projected to increase from approximately 514,000 in 2020 to approximately 1 million in 2060. The relative growth in new dementia cases was especially pronounced for Black adults. These results highlight the urgent need for policies that enhance healthy aging, with a focus on health equity.

The definition of dementia has been updated in the DSM-5 criteria. It is no longer termed Dementia but is now called Major Neurocognitive Disorder (MND). However, due to the common use of the term dementia in society and medical literature, it is referred to as both Dementia and MND in this topic. It is worth noting the limitations of using the term dementia, including its common association exclusively with older patients, and that it is often used synonymously with Alzheimer disease. MND can affect younger individuals and does not always imply Alzheimer disease as the etiology of cognitive decline. MND is characterized by a significant decline in at least 1 of the cognition domains, including executive function, complex attention, language, learning, memory, perceptual-motor, or social cognition. The decline represents a change from a patient's prior level of cognitive ability, is persistent and progressive over time, and is not associated exclusively with an episode of delirium. In addition to the cognitive decline, there must also be a decline in the patient's ability to function and perform everyday tasks. The everyday function of a patient is often evaluated in terms of the ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living, such as managing finances or medications, or, if more severe, activities of daily living, such as grooming or feeding oneself. It is often a progressive disorder, and individuals often do not have insight into their deficits. Currently, no cure exists for any of the causes of dementia. The prevalence of dementia is expected to continue to increase along with the increasing numbers of the aging population. Currently, 47 million people in the world have dementia, and the number is expected to increase to 131 million by 2050. Alzheimer disease is the 5th leading cause of death for people over the age of 65 in the United States. Dementia is a significant public health burden and significantly increases the costs of care, both to the individual and society. The individual lifetime cost to care for an individual with dementia was nearly $200,000 more than an individual without dementia. In 2010, the costs of treating dementia in the United States were projected to be about $200 billion per year in the United States and $600 billion worldwide.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex polygenic neurodegenerative disorder. Its genetic risk's relationship with all-cause dementia may be influenced by the plasma proteome. Up to 40,139 UK Biobank participants aged ≥ 50y at baseline assessment (2006-2010) were followed-up for ≤ 15 y for dementia incidence. Plasma proteomics were performed on a sub-sample of UK Biobank participants (k = 1,463 plasma proteins). AD polygenic risk scores (PRS) were used as the primary exposure and Cox proportional hazards models were conducted to examine the AD PRS-dementia relationship. A four-way decomposition model then partitioned the total effect (TE) of AD PRS on dementia into an effect due to mediation only, an effect due to interaction only, neither or both. The study found that AD PRS tertiles significantly increased the risk for all-cause dementia, particularly among women. The study specifically found that AD PRS was associated with a 79% higher risk for all-cause dementia for each unit increase (HR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.70-1.87, P < 0.001). Eighty-six plasma proteins were significantly predicted by AD PRS, including a positive association with PLA2G7, BRK1, the glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and negative with TREM2. Both GFAP and NfL significantly interacted synergistically with AD PRS to increase all-dementia risk (> 10% of TE is pure interaction), while GFAP was also an important consistent mediator in the AD PRS-dementia relationship. In summary, we detected significant interactions of NfL and GFAP with AD PRS, in relation to dementia incidence, suggesting potential for personalized dementia prevention and management.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADOD) are a growing public health concern in Japan. This study examines historical ADOD burden trends, identifies contributing risk factors, and forecasts future projections using time-series modeling. METHODS: This study uses the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2021 data to analyze ADOD trends in Japan, and assess incidence, mortality, and Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Regression analysis identifies risk factors, and an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is employed to forecasts the burden from 2021 to 2030. RESULTS: ADOD cases have steadily increased, with projections indicating continued growth by 2030. Aging and life expectancy are major contributors, with urban areas like Kantō and Kansai region experiencing higher prevalence than Tōhoku and Kyūshū. High fasting plasma glucose, obesity, and smoking are significant modifiable risk factors. The ARIMA model forecasts an ongoing upward trend, highlighting a rising public health challenge. DISCUSSION: Targeted policies, early interventions, and equitable health care access are vital to mitigating Japan's growing ADOD burden. HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADOD) are rising in Japan due to an aging population. Key risk factors include high fasting plasma glucose, obesity, and smoking. Kantō and Kansai region have higher ADOD prevalence than other region ARIMA modeling predicts a continuous increase in ADOD cases through 2030. Targeted health care policies and preventive measures are crucial to mitigate the burden.

Over the last three decades, the evidence on how to best treat the cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms of patients with Alzheimer's disease has increased. Although these pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies have significantly improved health outcomes for patients with Alzheimer's disease, many lack stringent evidence of efficacy. In this second paper of the Series, we provide practical and realistic advice on how to prioritise pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies to ameliorate cognitive impairment and behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. In this clinical environment, dementia specialists are faced with the challenge of holistically integrating the much anticipated and, in some respects, controversial anti-β amyloid monoclonal antibodies. Here, we present the current approval scenario of monoclonal antibodies, our view on how they might further contribute to improve patients' quality of life, and how they could be seamlessly integrated with existing best care options.

Lewy body-involving diseases (LBD) are commonly associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) featuring voluntary movement inhibition, due to dopaminergic neuron dysfunction in the substantia nigra. PD is clinically tracked through Lewy bodies (LB), composed of insoluble α-synuclein aggregates sequestered with organelles, particularly inside neurons. However, α-synuclein pathology also appears in incidental LBD, Parkinson's disease dementia, and dementia with LB (DLB). Incomplete explanations address how these clinical pathologies interrelate, LBD etiology variability, and frequently overlapping α-synuclein and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologies. We hypothesize that (1) chronic environmental insult exposure and (2) senescence(-like) neuron accumulation contribute toward initiating and sustaining LBD; individual cell vulnerability determines either cell reactivity, death, or senescence in response to environmental insults. We predicate that parkinsonian and other neurodegenerative symptoms over LBD progression involve (3) co-occurring AD pathologies, wherein dementia symptomology develops when synergistic glial senescence, tau hyperphosphorylation, and possible α-synuclein aggregation reach into regions involved in AD progression. HIGHLIGHTS: Senescence burden is predicted to explain α-synucleinopathy progression. Senescence and cell death are hypothesized to occur in α-synucleinopathies. Sub-apoptotic stress is proposed to induce senescence in α-synucleinopathies. Neuronal senescence likely first spreads α-synucleinopathies to new regions. Glial senescence likely underlies Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease overlap.

Dementia, with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) accounting for 60-70% of its occurrences, is a multifactorial disorder marked by cognitive and functional decline. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) stratify genetic risk for complex diseases, including AD. Integrating PRS with metabolomics offers a pathway to better understand AD etiology and identify biomarkers for early detection. We explored the association between AD PRS, metabolomics, and dementia risk using data from the UK Biobank. The analysis emphasizes sex-specific associations and the mediating role of metabolites between AD PRS and dementia risk. The study utilized data from 205,219 UK Biobank participants aged ≥ 50 years at baseline. Dementia outcomes were derived using ICD-10 codes. AD PRS were computed using genome-wide association study data, while metabolomic data included 249 biomarkers measured via Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. Time-to-event analyses (Cox proportional hazards models) and generalized structural equation modeling assessed associations and mediation effects, adjusting for age, sex, and genetic principal components. Higher AD PRS was associated with increased risks of all-cause dementia (HR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.70-1.79, P < 0.001) and AD (HR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.95-2.09, P < 0.001), with stronger effects in women for both outcomes when considering the main AD PRS which was related to APOE4 status. Metabolomic analyses identified lipid-related markers as key mediators. LDL phospholipid content was the metabolite marker with the strongest positive relationship with AD genetic risk (effect size, b = + 0.11), while HDL phospholipids percentage showed a similarly strong inverse association (effect size b = -0.09). No metabolomic markers were significantly associated with another version of AD PRS that was less correlated with APOE4 status. Mediation analyses applied to the main AD PRS revealed modest effects, with LDL-related metabolomic components partially mediating the effect of genetic risk on dementia incidence, through a protective type of mediation (< -2%). Nevertheless, most genetic risk operated independently of metabolites. AD PRS is significantly associated with dementia risk, with sex differences and metabolomic pathways providing further insights. Lipid metabolism, particularly LDL-centric measures, emerged as potential mediators. This integrative approach highlights the utility of combining genetic and metabolomic data to identify biomarkers and potential targets for early intervention in AD and dementia.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating form of dementia, with the number of affected individuals rising sharply. The main hallmarks of the disease include amyloid-beta plaque deposits and neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, besides other pathological features that contribute to the disease's complexity. The causes of sporadic AD are multifactorial and mostly age-related and involve risk factors such as diabetes and cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disorders. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is another type of dementia characterized by a spectrum of behaviors, memory, and motor abnormalities and associated with abnormal depositions of protein aggregation, including tau protein. Currently approved medications are symptomatic, and no disease-modifying therapy is available to halt the disease progression. Therefore, the development of multi-targeted therapeutic approaches could hold promise for the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders, including tauopathies. In this article, we will discuss the pathophysiology of AD and FTD, the proposed hypotheses, and current therapeutic approaches, highlighting the development of novel drug candidates and the progress of clinical trials in this field of research.

INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the impacts of brexpiprazole treatment on patient neuropsychiatric symptoms and caregiver distress in Japanese patients with agitation in Alzheimer's dementia (AAD). METHODS: In a phase 2/3 multicenter, double-blind study, patients were randomized to receive brexpiprazole 1 or 2 mg/day, or placebo (3:4:4) for 10 weeks. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was used for evaluation. The areas of patient symptoms and caregiver distress were defined as NPI and NPI-Distress, respectively. RESULTS: At Week 10, the differences of brexpiprazole 1 and 2 mg versus placebo for NPI total score were -1.2 (p = 0.5891) and -8.4 (p < 0.0001), and those for NPI-Distress total score were -1.1 (p = 0.2292) and -3.9 (p < 0.0001), respectively. In brexpiprazole 2 mg versus placebo, NPI and NPI-Distress agitation/aggression score showed ≥ 2 and ≥ 1 point improvement, respectively. DISCUSSION: Brexpiprazole is suggested to improve patient symptoms and to reduce caregiver distress in the treatment of AAD in Japanese patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03620981 HIGHLIGHTS: Brexpiprazole improved symptoms of patients with agitation in Alzheimer's dementia. The improvements included not only agitation, but also various behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia scores. The improvements of patient symptoms led to the reduction of caregiver distress. Our study suggests that brexpiprazole is beneficial for both patients and caregivers.

BACKGROUND: The effect of statins on the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. METHODS: We systematically searched EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed, CENTRAL and ClinicalTrail.gov for cohort studies comparing incidence of new-onset dementia and AD between statin users and non-users. We applied the DerSimonian-Laird random effects method to pool hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: We included forty-two studies comprising 6,325,740 patients. Thirty-five cohort studies involving 6,306,043 participants were pooled and indicated that statin use was associated with a reduced risk of dementia (HR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.71-0.88). Similarly, an analysis of 19 studies comprising 1,237,341 participants demonstrated a 29% decrease in the risk of AD among statin users (HR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.60-0.85). In sensitivity analyses, diagnostic criteria for dementia/AD significantly affected the combined risk estimates. In subgroup analyses, compared to studies enrolling participants with a mean/median age over 70 years, those younger than 70 years exhibited greater efficacy of statins in preventing dementia (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.56-0.81 vs HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.78-0.95; P = 0.02) and AD (HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.44-0.50 vs. HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.71-0.92; P < 0.01). Due to significant heterogeneity in the definitions of statin dosage and exposure duration, pooling the results was abandoned and most studies suggested that higher dosages and longer exposure duration of statins further reduce the risk of dementia and AD. CONCLUSION: Statin use is associated with a reduced incidence of dementia and AD, which might be modified by ages.

IMPORTANCE: Long-term exposure to total fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a recognized dementia risk factor, but less is known about wildfire-generated PM2.5, an increasingly common PM2.5 source. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between long-term wildfire and nonwildfire PM2.5 exposure and risk of incident dementia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This open cohort study was conducted using January 2008 to December 2019 electronic health record (EHR) data among members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), which serves 4.7 million people across 10 California counties. KPSC members aged 60 years or older were eligible for inclusion. Members were excluded if they did not meet eligibility criteria, if they had a dementia diagnosis before cohort entry, or if EHR data lacked address information. Data analysis was conducted from May 2023 to May 2024. EXPOSURES: Three-year rolling mean wildfire and nonwildfire PM2.5 in member census tracts from January 2006 to December 2019, updated quarterly and estimated via monitoring and remote-sensing data and statistical techniques. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was incident dementia, identified using diagnostic codes in the EHR. Odds of dementia diagnoses associated with 3-year mean wildfire and nonwildfire PM2.5 exposure were estimated using a discrete-time approach with pooled logistic regression. Models adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity (considered as a social construct rather than as a biological determinant), marital status, smoking status, calendar year, and census tract-level poverty and population density. Stratified models assessed effect measure modification by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and census tract-level poverty. RESULTS: Among 1.64 million KPSC members aged 60 years or older during the study period, 1 223 107 members were eligible for inclusion in this study. The study population consisted of 644 766 female members (53.0%). In total, 319 521 members identified as Hispanic (26.0%), 601 334 members identified as non-Hispanic White (49.0%), and 80 993 members received a dementia diagnosis during follow-up (6.6%). In adjusted models, a 1-μg/m3 increase in the 3-year mean of wildfire PM2.5 exposure was associated with an 18% increase in the odds of dementia diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03-1.34). In comparison, a 1-μg/m3 increase in nonwildfire PM2.5 exposure was associated with a 1% increase (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02). For wildfire PM2.5 exposure, associations were stronger among members less than 75 years old upon cohort entry, members from racially minoritized subgroups, and those living in high-poverty vs low-poverty census tracts. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, after adjusting for measured confounders, long-term exposure to wildfire and nonwildfire PM2.5 over a 3-year period was associated with dementia diagnoses. As the climate changes, interventions focused on reducing wildfire PM2.5 exposure may reduce dementia diagnoses and related inequities.

Citalopram is effective in treating agitation in Alzheimer's dementia (AD), but it is associated with cognitive and cardiac risks, likely due to its R-enantiomer. Escitalopram, the S-enantiomer, may be an alternative. In this double-masked randomized (1:1) placebo-controlled trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of escitalopram in treating agitation in AD after failure of a psychosocial intervention (PSI). Assessments occurred at enrollment, post-PSI (baseline) and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks post-baseline. Settings were 27 community-based centers. The target randomization sample was 392 participants. Participants were adults with AD, a Mini-Mental State Examination Telephone score of 3-20 and significant agitation. PSI non-responders received escitalopram (up to 15 mg per day) or placebo for 12 weeks while continuing PSI. The outcome was the proportion of participants with clinically significant improvement in agitation from baseline at 12 weeks. In total, 173 participants were randomized (84 escitalopram versus 89 placebo; mean ± s.d. age = 78.4 ± 8.7 years; 90 men (52.0%); 127 White (73.4%)). The unadjusted risk difference at 12 weeks was 0.08 (95% confidence interval: -0.21, 0.06). Drug-related QT interval prolongation was observed. Although the randomized sample was smaller than planned, escitalopram was not effective in treating agitation in AD and was associated with cardiac conduction delays. Clinicians need to be cautious in recommending escitalopram as an alternative to citalopram for this condition. ClincialTrials.gov identifier: NCT03108846 .

Early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) with mild dementia is becoming increasingly important to enable patients to receive appropriate treatment with available amyloid-targeting therapies. Reviews of AD prevalence and diagnostic and treatment patterns typically focus on global or western populations, but the situation in Asia, Australasia, and Pacific Nations (AAPN) countries is less clear. We performed a narrative review of literature for AD in several AAPN countries, focusing on patients with MCI or mild dementia who may benefit from early treatment. Published information regarding AD incidence and prevalence and current practice in AAPN countries is limited and the nature of available information differs between countries. However, AAPN countries include some of the most rapidly aging populations and show the associated increasing trend of all-cause dementia prevalence observed globally. Although lecanemab and donanemab are now approved for AD with MCI and mild dementia in several AAPN countries, the most appropriate diagnostic pathway for patients with MCI and early AD is not established. Even though the AAPN region includes countries with routine access to advanced technologies, concerns have already been raised about the ability of healthcare systems in Australia, New Zealand, and Korea to respond to approvals of new AD therapies, including the need to ensure availability of biomarker testing and dementia specialists to allow patients to receive the early diagnosis required to enable appropriate treatment. Guidelines and national policies also need updating to differentiate between dementia subtypes and include amyloid-targeting therapies for eligible patients with early AD.

INTRODUCTION: Plasma biomarkers sensitive to Alzheimer's disease (AD) proteinopathy prior to the onset of dementia have significant implications for early detection. METHODS: In 304 individuals without dementia, we investigated whether C(2)N Diagnostics' mass spectrometry (MS)-based plasma biomarkers (amyloid beta 42/40, %phosphorylated tau [p-tau]181, and %p-tau217) and amyloid probability scores (APS, PrecivityAD and APS2, PrecivityAD2) are associated with brain amyloid, brain tau, or preclinical cognitive decline. RESULTS: In this cohort study, %p-tau217 and the APS2 had high discriminative accuracy (area under the curve > 0.93) for identifying elevated brain amyloid and tau and were associated with faster preclinical cognitive decline. Using %p-tau217 or the APS2 in a theoretical AD trial screening scenario reduced amyloid positron emission tomography imaging costs up to 41% or 45%, respectively. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that C(2)N Diagnostics' MS-based plasma biomarkers can detect brain amyloid and tau with high accuracy prior to dementia and could aid in identifying candidates for clinical trials or therapeutic intervention. HIGHLIGHTS: C(2)N plasma biomarkers differentiated Alzheimer's disease proteinopathy status prior to dementia. Plasma %phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 and the C(2)N Diagnostics PrecivityAD2 (APS2) were concordant with amyloid and tau positron emission tomography status. Plasma %p-tau217 and the APS2 were associated with preclinical cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND: Adults with Down syndrome (DS) have a 90% lifetime risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), with neurobiological pathology present decades prior to dementia onset. The profile and timing of cognitive decline in DS is well-documented. However, there is a small body of research on whether Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) occur early on in the progression of AD in DS and are associated with early AD pathology (i.e., amyloid-beta [Aβ] and neurofibrillary tau tangles [NFT]). METHODS: Data were analyzed from 337 adults with DS (M = 45.13 years, SD = 9.53 years) enrolled in a large cohort study. The Reiss Screen for Maladaptive Behavior (RSMB) measured common behaviors reported in BPSD across up to four study cycles (spaced approximately 16 months apart). Linear mixed models estimated change in BPSD as predicted by baseline (a) dementia status (i.e., cognitively stable, mild cognitive impairment [MCI], or dementia), (b) Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [(11)C] PiB, and (c) NFT PET tracer [(18)F]AV-1451. Models controlled for chronological age, sex, study site, premorbid intellectual disability level, APOE e4 allele carrier status, psychiatric diagnoses, and psychiatric medication use. RESULTS: Compared to cognitively stable participants, participants whose status was MCI or dementia, had significantly higher baseline RSMB subdomain scores. Increases in RSMB Depression-Behavioral, Depression-Physical, and Psychosis were observed for participants with MCI. Higher baseline Aβ and NFT were associated with higher RSMB Avoidant at baseline, and increases in RSMB Depression-Physical and Psychosis over time. CONCLUSIONS: BPSD are an important part of AD in DS, particularly during the prodromal stage. Elevated Aβ and NFT predict higher initial avoidance and change in physical depression behaviors and may indicate MCI in adults with DS. Broader increases in BPSD are observed as adults with DS progress from early to late-stage dementia. Clinicians should rule out other possible causes of BPSD when screening for AD, such as stressful life experiences or co-occurring medical conditions. Caregivers of adults with DS should have resources on BPSD management and self-care strategies.

"Sundowning syndrome" refers to the evening decline in mental state among cognitively impaired patients. This phenomenon is well known, but it is not entirely understood. Its prevalence ranges from 1.6% to 66% of patients with dementia. Development of SS relies on neurodegeneration, the presence of sleep disorders, circadian rhythm of patients' activities, and mood disorders. Therefore, patients with SS need very precise diagnostic workup aiming at defining the exact cause of the syndrome. Potential therapeutic modalities include behavioral and environmental interventions and pharmacological approaches. Pharmacotherapy with sedatives can by effective but is related to severe side effects. Behavioral interventions are more efficacious but require intense involvement of caregivers. This article discusses the biological processes that may underlie SS and proposes potential diagnostic procedures and therapeutic interventions.

Mixed dementia is caused most often by the coexistence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) pathologies. This disease presents challenges due to its complex, dual pathology. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the pathophysiology of AD and VaD, with a particular emphasis on vascular factors that accelerate or exacerbate AD pathology. We then describe animal models, in vitro cell culture systems, and brain organoid models that have been developed or are currently being developed to elucidate the neurodegenerative and vascular components of MD. This review provides an evaluation of the panorama of factors that influence MD pathophysiology and how basic science models can incorporate these factors to advance the knowledge related to the mechanisms of the disease and guide the screening of novel therapeutic approaches.

PURPOSE: Differentiating between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) can be challenging due to overlapping cognitive and behavioral manifestations. Evidence regarding non-invasive and early-stage biomarkers remains limited. Our aim was to identify retinal biomarkers for the risk of AD and FTD in populations without dementia and explore underlying brain structural mechanisms. METHODS: We included a total of 3,0573 UK Biobank participants without dementia, ocular disorders, and diabetes who underwent baseline retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the associations between macular OCT parameters and the risk of AD and FTD. Mediation analysis was used to explore the underlying mechanisms affected by brain structures. RESULTS: The mean age at recruitment was 55.27, and 46.10% of the participants were male. During a mean follow-up of 9.15 ± 2.59 years, 148 patients with AD and eight patients with FTD were identified. Reduced thickness of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) at baseline was associated with an increased risk of AD (HR, 1.033; 95% CI, 1.001-1.066; P = 0.044), while thinner retinal pigment epithelial in the inner superior subfield at baseline was associated with an elevated risk of FTD (HR, 1.409; 95% CI, 1.060-1.871; P = 0.018). Structurally abnormal visual pathways, including cortical and subcortical gray matter volumes, as well as white matter integrity, mediated the association between the GC-IPL thickness and AD risk. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide preliminary empirical support for a relationship between prodromal changes in retinal layers and a higher risk of AD or FTD, suggesting that macular OCT may serve as a non-invasive, sensitive biomarker of high-risk years before the onset of dementia.

INTRODUCTION: Much research has been conducted into the role and safety of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies on the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the historical approval of three drugs by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of early AD, there remains other potential treatment, which is yet to be approved or further developed. This systematic review explores the efficacy of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of early AD from reported clinical trials. METHODS: Authors conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE and Embase. Screening was carried out by two authors and cross-checked thereafter. Clinical changes in cognition and objective measures such as cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and imaging constituted primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. RESULTS: Our search yielded 14 randomized controlled trials; the primary focus of the included trials is amyloid-β. The monoclonal antibodies reported in this review are: lecanemab, aducanumab, crenezumab, solanezumab, donanemab, bapineuzumab, and gantenerumab. The most common finding among the trials is the lack of statistically significant results in measures of clinical outcomes, (e.g., Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes, AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale). However, specific trials investigating lecanemab, aducanumab, and donanemab demonstrated promising improvements in clinical cognition. Results related to secondary outcomes were also mixed, but showed more positive findings across the included trials. Overall, primary outcomes were inconsistent with secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the need to consider the complex pathophysiology of AD in treatment development. Focusing solely on the amyloid-beta hypothesis may be inadequate; further research is necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms and develop treatments for the multifactorial nature of the disease.

INTRODUCTION: Progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia from normal cognition (NC) can follow different trajectories, with most progressing through a recognizable mild cognitive impairment stage (NC-MCI-AD), while some individuals transition quickly from NC to AD dementia (NC-AD). METHODS: We compared demographic characteristics, health factors, and cognitive and functional assessments across three time points: the first NC visit, the last NC visit, and the first AD dementia visit. RESULTS: The NC-MCI-AD group showed greater impairment in cognitive and functional scores at AD dementia diagnosis, despite maintaining better cognitive function during the NC stage. Analysis of yearly changes revealed negligible differences during NC. However, the yearly change during the AD dementia stage suggested potentially more rapid functional decline in the NC-AD group. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the heterogeneity in AD disease progression and emphasize the importance of considering diverse progression patterns in AD research and clinical practice. HIGHLIGHTS: We investigated the disease progression difference between patients who converted to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia from normal cognition (NC) directly or through the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. We found that the NC-MCI-AD group showed greater impairment in cognitive and functional scores at AD dementia diagnosis. We discovered that the NC-AD group had rapid functional decline once patients were confirmed with AD onset.

Mounting evidence implicates brain lymphatic drainage in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Several recent basic and clinical science discoveries have suggested the impact of lymphatic therapy to stimulate lymph flow in the head and neck including improvement in cognition. Manual lymphatic drainage has potential as a simple inexpensive way to promote brain lymph drainage and is worthy of a well-designed clinical trial to evaluate its potential as a primary or adjunctive treatment of Alzheimer's disease at this time.

Dementia is a group of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia, metabolic dementia and toxic dementia. The treatment of dementia mainly includes symptomatic treatment by controlling the primary disease and accompanying symptoms, nutritional support therapy for repairing nerve cells, psychological auxiliary treatment, and treatment that improves cognitive function through drugs. Among them, drug therapy to improve cognitive function is important. This review focuses on introducing and commenting on some recent progress in exploring drugs to improve cognitive function, especially the new progress in drug treatment for AD. We mainly discuss the opportunities and challenges in finding and developing new therapeutic drugs from the aspects of acetylcholinesterase, N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor, amyloid protein, tau protein and chronic immune inflammation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly recognized as a condition shaped not only by central nervous system pathology but also by complex, bidirectional interactions between the gut, brain, and immune system. This review synthesizes emerging evidence on gut-brain-immune dysregulation in AD, with particular attention to how chronic stress, microbial imbalance, and neuroimmune signaling converge to influence disease risk and progression. We move beyond traditional microbiome-focused perspectives to incorporate non-microbial gut-derived mediators, including enteroendocrine hormones, bile acids, and vagal neuropeptides, which contribute to immune modulation, neurotransmission, and brain homeostasis. Importantly, we highlight that AD-related neurodegeneration can also feedback to impair gastrointestinal function and microbial composition, creating a self-reinforcing pathological loop. The review integrates recent findings on the role of host genetic polymorphisms, such as APOE4 and TREM2, in modulating gut permeability, immune tone, and microbiota profiles-emphasizing a systems biology model in which genome-microbiome interactions shape AD susceptibility. We also explore how single-cell omics technologies and multi-organ frameworks are redefining our understanding of gut-brain-immune circuits at cellular resolution. The translational section critically evaluates current and potential therapeutic strategies, including dietary, microbial, behavioral, and endocrine interventions, while addressing the challenges of applying preclinical findings to diverse human populations across the disease spectrum. By incorporating age-, stage-, and genotype-specific considerations, this review offers a comprehensive and timely synthesis of the gut-brain-stress axis in AD, positioning it as a key frontier in mechanistic research and precision therapeutic development.

INTRODUCTION: Lewy body dementia (LBD) shares genetic risk factors with Alzheimer's disease (AD), including apolipoprotein E (APOE), but is distinguishable at the genome-wide level. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) may therefore improve diagnostic classification. METHODS: We assessed diagnostic classification using AD-PRS excluding APOE (AD-PRS(no) (APOE)), APOE risk score (APOE-RS), and plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181), in 83 participants with LBD, 27 with positron emission tomography amyloid beta (Aβ)positive mild cognitive impairment or AD (MCI+/AD), and 57 controls. RESULTS: Together AD-PRS(no) (APOE) and APOE-RS performed similarly to p-tau181 in discriminating MCI+/AD from controls (area under the curve 76% vs. 79%) and LBD (71% vs. 72%). In LBD, Aβ positivity was significantly associated with APOE-RS, but not with AD-PRS(no) (APOE), or p-tau181. Combining AD-PRS(no) (APOE), APOE-RS, and p-tau181 improved the discrimination of MCI+/AD from controls (81%) and LBD (75%), and the detection of Aβ in LBD (82%). DISCUSSION: Aβ deposition in LBD was associated with APOE, while MCI+/AD was also associated with AD-PRS beyond APOE. AD-PRS explains phenotypic variance not captured by APOE or p-tau181. HIGHLIGHTS: We investigated Alzheimer's disease (AD) polygenic risk score (PRS), apolipoprotein E (APOE), and plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) to classify AD and Lewy body dementia (LBD). AD-PRS with APOE achieved similar classification accuracy to p-tau181. AD-PRS without APOE significantly contributed to discriminating AD from LBD. Amyloid beta positivity in LBD was associated with APOE but not AD-PRS without APOE or p-tau181. Combining AD-PRS, APOE, and p-tau181 improved diagnostic classification accuracy.

Nucleocytoplasmic transport defects are observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Here, we assess mRNA nucleocytoplasmic localization by performing transcriptome-wide profiling on nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of human iPSC-derived cortical neurons from healthy individuals compared to those with familial AD or FTD. We find that AD- and FTD-causing mutations induce significant changes in mRNA nucleocytoplasmic distribution. We additionally observe the redistribution of mitochondria-related transcripts across AD and FTD neurons. The significantly increased mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) in the cytosol of AD and FTD mutant neurons raised the possibility of leakage, which motivated us to investigate mtDNA leakage. We reveal abnormal cytoplasmic accumulation of mtDNA in AD and FTD cortical neurons together with evidence of mitochondrial aberrance. Importantly, mislocalisation of nucleic acids, mitochondrial dysfunction and cGAS-STING activation can be ameliorated through VCP D2 ATPase inhibition.

The mechanisms linking a history of major depressive disorder (MDD) to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) are not fully understood. Using the UK Biobank, we evaluated the biological mechanisms linking both conditions. In participants without history of MDD, 493 proteins were significantly associated with the risk of ADRD. In contrast, in participants with a history of MDD at baseline, a smaller set of 6 proteins were significantly associated ADRD risk (NfL, GFAP, PSG1. VGF, GET3, and HPGDS), with GET3 being specifically associated with ADRD risk in the latter group. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis ahowed that the APOE and IL-10 receptor subunit B genes were causally linked to incident ADRD. Finally, we developed a Proteomic Risk Score (PrRS(MDD-ADRD)), which showed strong discriminative power (C-statistic = 0.84) to identify participants with MDD who developed ADRD upon follow-up. Here we show that plasma proteins associated with inflammation and amyloid-β metabolism are causally linked to a higher ADRD risk in individuals with MDD. Moreover, the PrRS(MDD-ADRD) can be useful to identify individuals with the highest risk of developing ADRD in a highly vulnerable population.

Globally, the human population is ageing, and, consequently, the prevalence of major neurocognitive disorders is increasing, resulting in a greater need for novel dementia therapeutic interventions. Animal models are invaluable in studying underlying pathological processes in human diseases and with evidence for rising life expectancy in many domesticated animals studies have investigated neurocognitive disorders in several non-human species. Rodents have been used extensively as animal models, but this review will examine published literature suggesting candidate non-laboratory animal models for studying dementia, especially human Alzheimer's disease. Comparison of the physiological, pathological and clinical features of companion animals, farm animals and marine mammals shows that although many animals develop amyloid plaques and, to lesser degree, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, very few develop neurofibrillary tangles or neuronal loss to the same extent as humans with Alzheimer's disease. Several hypotheses are proposed as to why, as yet, no animals have been found to spontaneously develop Alzheimer's disease-like pathology to the same level as humans but highlight specific aspects where these models may be useful if developed further.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD) are the leading causes of dementia, presenting a significant challenge in differential diagnosis. While their clinical presentations can overlap, their underlying pathologies are distinct. AD is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, leading to progressive neurodegeneration. VD, on the other hand, arises from cerebrovascular insults that disrupt blood flow to the brain, causing neuronal injury and cognitive decline. Despite distinct etiologies, AD and VD share common risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Recent research suggests a potential role for oral microbiota in both diseases, warranting further investigation. The diagnostic dilemma lies in the significant overlap of symptoms including memory loss, executive dysfunction, and personality changes. The absence of definitive biomarkers and limitations of current neuroimaging techniques necessitate a multi-modal approach integrating clinical history, cognitive assessment, and neuroimaging findings. Promising avenues for improved diagnosis include the exploration of novel biomarkers like inflammatory markers, MMPs, and circulating microRNAs. Additionally, advanced neuroimaging techniques hold promise in differentiating AD and VD by revealing characteristic cerebrovascular disease patterns and brain atrophy specific to each condition. By elucidating the complexities underlying AD and VD, we can refine diagnostic accuracy and optimize treatment strategies for this ever-growing patient population. Future research efforts should focus on identifying disease-specific biomarkers and developing more effective neuroimaging methods to achieve a definitive diagnosis and guide the development of targeted therapies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) progressively impairs the memory and thinking skills of patients, resulting in a significant global economic and social burden each year. However, diagnosis of this neurodegenerative disorder can be challenging, particularly in the early stages of developing cognitive decline. Current clinical techniques are expensive, laborious, and invasive, which hinders comprehensive studies on Alzheimer's biomarkers and the development of efficient devices for Point-of-Care testing (POCT) applications. To address these limitations, researchers have been investigating various biosensing techniques. Unfortunately, these methods have not been commercialized due to several drawbacks, such as low efficiency, reproducibility, and the lack of accurate identification of AD markers. In this review, we present diverse promising hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease identified in various biofluids and body behaviors. Additionally, we thoroughly discuss different biosensing mechanisms and the associated challenges in disease diagnosis. In each context, we highlight the potential of realizing new biosensors to study various features of the disease, facilitating its early diagnosis in POCT. This comprehensive study, focusing on recent efforts for different aspects of the disease and representing promising opportunities, aims to conduct the future trend toward developing a new generation of compact multipurpose devices that can address the challenges in the early detection of AD.

BACKGROUND: Research concerning the genetic risk for dementia has recently been headed towards new directions. Novel findings from genome-wide association studies have highlighted the association of Alzheimer's disease incidence with many gene polymorphisms, apart from the Apolipoprotein-E genotype. The identification of additional genetic risk factors has led to the construction of specific genetic risk scores for dementia, considering many different genetic factors and specific biological pathways related to Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis method, summarizing existing data regarding genetic risk scores for Alzheimer's disease and dementia, in order to improve the current understanding of the genetic underpinnings of dementia. In specific, five databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of science, and Cochrane Central) were searched using the keywords "genetic risk score", "Alzheimer's disease", and "dementia" with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: From the 552 articles identified, we finally included 20 studies for the qualitative analysis. These reports were classified in three different categories of genetic scores: "polygenic risk scores (PRSs)" (including 11 studies), "pathway specific polygenic risk scores (p-PRSs)" (5 studies), and "complex genetic risk scores" (4 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Existing genetic risk scores have contributed to better dementia prediction and a better understanding of the underlying pathology. Novel approaches integrating multiple polygenic risk scores might ameliorate the accuracy of genetic risk scores. The combination of polygenic risk scores that are specific to related biological pathways or relevant biomarkers is of utmost importance to achieve a better predictive ability.

INTRODUCTION: In the research setting, obtaining accurate established biomarker measurements and maximizing use of the precious samples is key. Accurate technologies are available for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but no platform can measure all the established and emerging biomarkers in one run. The NUcleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA) is a technology that requires 15 µL of sample to measure more than 100 analytes. METHODS: We compared AD-relevant biomarkers included in the NULISA against validated assays in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. RESULTS: CSF measures of amyloid beta 42/40, and phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 are highly correlated when measured by immunoassay, mass spectrometry, or NULISA. In plasma, p-tau217 performance is similar to that reported with other technologies when predicting amyloidosis. Other biomarkers show a wide range of correlation values depending on the fluid and the platform. DISCUSSION: The NULISA multiplexed platform produces reliable results for established biomarkers in CSF that are useful in research settings, with the advantage of measuring additional biomarkers using minimal sample volume. HIGHLIGHTS: We tested the novel technology NUcleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA) in the dementia research setting. NULISA multiplexed platform produces reliable results for established and emerging biomarkers using minimal sample volume. Cerebrospinal fluid measures of amyloid beta 42/40, and phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 are highly correlated when measured by immunoassay, mass spectrometry, or NULISA. In plasma, p-tau217 performance is similar to that reported with other technologies when predicting amyloidosis. NULISA measures are useful in research settings, with the advantage of measuring additional biomarkers using minimal sample volume.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are often accompanied, but there are no effective differential diagnosis and treatment for VaD. The search for common pathogenic targets or pathways connecting the two diseases is helpful to the drug development and treatment of the disease. In this study, we used gene expression array data from the GEO database to analyze common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the temporal cortex of patients with AD and VaD. AD and VaD shared 143 DEGs. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis showed that the biological function of common DEGs was mainly related to chemical synaptic transmission, neuroactive ligand-receptor, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis showed the interaction of down- and up-regulated DEGs. The mRNA expression levels of key proteins in neuroactive ligand-receptor and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway were verified in AD and VaD mice. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test was used to detect the expression of DEGs. Data of RT-qPCR showed the mRNA level of γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 1 (GABBR1) was decreased in both AD and VaD. In addition, the mRNA of interleukin-17 receptor A (IL-17RA), IL-17 and IL-18 were increased. In conclusion, the shared genes in AD and VaD were verified in our study. We identified the critical genes to offer a theoretical basis for understanding the linkage of AD and VaD, which provided potential drug targets against AD and VaD.

Obesity is recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD dementia). Emerging evidence indicates that obesity in AD patients is associated with heightened neuropsychiatric symptoms, as reflected by inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and complement C3. Neuroinflammation, particularly through certain aspects of microglial activation, plays a significant role in AD development and cognitive decline. While further research is warranted to explore these neuroinflammatory pathways as potential therapeutic targets, proactive weight management starting in middle age may help mitigate both cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

This review aims to explore the relationship between periodontitis and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementia. It also aims to evaluate the existing evidence and discuss whether periodontitis could be considered a modifiable risk factor in the prevention or progression of neurodegenerative conditions. Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and dementia are among the most challenging health issues of our time, especially with aging populations worldwide. Interestingly, recent research suggests that the health of our mouth-particularly chronic gum disease known as periodontitis-might be more closely linked to brain health than we ever realized. This review explores the growing body of evidence connecting periodontitis with neurodegeneration. We examine how oral bacteria and the inflammation they cause can enter the bloodstream, reach the brain, and potentially trigger or worsen conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. From preclinical models to clinical trials, the data show intriguing overlaps in the biological pathways involved, particularly inflammation, immune responses, and abnormal protein accumulation. While more research is still needed to confirm direct cause-and-effect relationships, the existing findings raise an important question: could improving oral health be a simple, preventive step toward protecting the brain? This review aims to shed light on that possibility and encourages further exploration into treating periodontitis not just as a dental issue, but as a potential key to slowing down or preventing neurodegenerative diseases.

Aromatase inhibitors are used for patients with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent cause of dementia. Several studies have suggested an association between the use of aromatase inhibitors and the development of Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study was to identify potential pharmacovigilance signals associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease and third-generation aromatase inhibitors in menopausal and postmenopausal women. VigiBase, the global database of individual case safety reports of the World Health Organization, was used to investigate this possible association. A disproportionality analysis was performed for women aged 45 years and older. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and its 95% CI for reporting dementia are exemestane, 2.08 (1.35-3.19); anastrozole, 1.59 (1.09-2.32); and letrozole, 1.43 (1.05-1.95) and for Alzheimer's disease are exemestane, 0.94 (0.30-2.92); anastrozole: 2.63 (1.55-4.45); and letrozole, 1.33 (0.76-2.35). For senile dementia, only letrozole has cases, with an ROR of 6.77 (2.51-18.31). Signals of disproportionate reporting have been observed between the occurrence of dementia, dementia Alzheimer's type, and senile dementia with aromatase inhibitors, which is in line with estrogen functions and aromatase activity, as well as the findings from preclinical studies. Additional research is required to elucidate this intricate matter.

BACKGROUND: Dietary choline intake has been associated with a lower risk of cognitive dysfunction, lessened brain white-matter hyperintensity volume, and a reduced risk of incident dementia. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the relationship between dietary choline intake and risk of clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) in participants enrolled in the Rush Memory and Aging Project prospective cohort. METHODS: Participants who were free of AD at baseline and had completed ≥1 food frequency questionnaire were included in the present analyses. Clinical AD was assessed among participants annually using a 3-stage process of neurological examinations and standardized diagnostic criteria. Dietary choline intake was quantified using the United States Department of Agriculture Database for the Choline Content of Common Foods. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess risk of incident of AD by quantiles of dietary choline intake. Mixed-effect Poisson regression models were used to investigate potential nonlinear relationships. RESULTS: Mean baseline age of the study participants (N = 991) was 81.4 (±7.2) y. During a mean follow-up of 7.67 y, 266 participants (27%) were clinically diagnosed with AD (incident rate = 38/1000 person-year). In the fully adjusted model, compared with the lowest quantile of dietary choline intake, consumption of 200-250, 251-300, 301-350, and >350 mg/d were associated with a 23% [hazard ratio (HR): 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.45, 1.17; P = 0.10], 40% (HR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.98; P = 0.04), 38% (HR = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.36, 1.07; P = 0.09), and 51% (HR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.95; P = 0.04) reduced rate of AD, respectively. Results of the curve linear Poisson regression model showed the point of lowest risk for AD to be ∼350 mg/d with effects being similar based on apolipoprotein E gene genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary choline intake ∼ 350 mg/d was associated with the lowest risk of clinical diagnosis of AD in older adults.

Curing Alzheimer's disease remains hampered by an incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology and progression. Exploring dysfunction in medial temporal lobe networks, particularly the anterior-temporal (AT) and posterior-medial (PM) systems, might provide key insights, because these networks exhibit alterations in functional connectivity along the entire Alzheimer's continuum, potentially influencing disease propagation. However, the specific changes in each network and their clinical relevance across stages are not yet fully understood. This requires consideration of commonly used biomarkers, clinical progression, individual variability and age confounds. Here, we leveraged monocentric longitudinal data from 261 participants spanning the adult lifespan and the Alzheimer's continuum. The sample included cognitively unimpaired adults aged 19-85 years (n = 209; 8 of 64 older adults >60 years of age were amyloid-β-positive) and amyloid-β-positive patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 26; 18 progressed to Alzheimer-dementia within 7 years) or Alzheimer's-type dementia (n = 26). Participants underwent structural and resting-state functional MRI, florbetapir and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET and global cognitive assessments, with up to three visits over a maximum period of 47 months. Network connectivity was assessed using seed-based analyses with the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices as seeds, within data-driven masks reflecting the AT and PM networks. Generalized additive and linear mixed models were run to assess age-specific effects and Alzheimer's-related alterations. In this context, we explored various markers of pathological and clinical severity, including cerebral amyloid uptake, glucose metabolism, hippocampal volume, global cognition, diagnostic staging and time to dementia onset. Our findings revealed distinct patterns of connectivity linked to normal ageing or Alzheimer's disease. Advancing age throughout adulthood was associated with lower PM connectivity and more subtle changes in AT connectivity, and Alzheimer's disease was characterized by AT hyperconnectivity without global changes in PM connectivity. Specifically, AT connectivity was higher in MCI and Alzheimer-dementia patients compared with older controls and was positively associated with amyloid burden, glucose hypometabolism, hippocampal atrophy and global cognitive deficits in older adults, ranging from unimpaired to demented. Additionally, higher AT connectivity was correlated with faster progression to Alzheimer-dementia in MCI patients. This comprehensive approach allowed us to reveal that excessive connectivity within the AT network is linked intrinsically to the pathological and clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease. These insights might guide future research to a better understanding of cascading events leading to the disease and hold promise for developing prognostic tools and therapeutic interventions targeting these specific network alterations.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the elderly population; and is characterized by the gradual loss of memory, cognition, and ability to carry out daily activities. However, a growing body of research indicates that there exists a subtype of Alzheimer's disease known as Atypical Alzheimer's disease. Atypical Alzheimer's disease is a rare form of dementia that differs from the typical presentation of Alzheimer's disease, such as variations in the age of onset, distribution of brain pathology, and clinical symptoms. The patients affected have a younger age of onset and have predominantly visual, language, executive function, motor, and behavioral dysfunction. The diagnosis requires a comprehensive neurological evaluation with specific attention to cognitive and behavioral changes while ruling out other potential causes of dementia. Emerging biomarkers including CSF profiles, amyloid and tau PET imaging, and advanced neuroimaging techniques offer promising avenues for improving diagnostic accuracy and understanding disease mechanisms. In this article, we focus on atypical presentations seen in the posterior cortical variant, frontal variant, progressive aphasic variant, corticobasal syndrome and look at the specific biomarkers used in the diagnosis of each variant along with focusing on the treatment of the disease. We also aim to provide an understanding of Atypical Alzheimer's disease, its clinical features, the biomarkers helping in diagnosing the disease, the current treatment guidelines, and the current scientific advancements in the field.

IMPORTANCE: Psychological traits reflecting neuroticism, depressive symptoms, loneliness, and purpose in life are risk factors of AD dementia; however, the underlying biologic mechanisms of these associations remain largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether one or more multi-omic brain molecular subtypes of AD is associated with neuroticism, depressive symptoms, loneliness, and/or purpose in life. DESIGN: Two cohort-based studies; Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), both ongoing longitudinal clinical pathological studies that began enrollment in 1994 and 1997. SETTING: Older priests, nuns, and brothers from across the U.S. (ROS) and older adults from across the greater Chicago metropolitan area (MAP). PARTICIPANTS: 822 decedents with multi-omic data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. EXPOSURES: Pseudotime, representing molecular distance from no cognitive impairment (NCI) to AD dementia, and three multi-omic brain molecular subtypes of AD dementia representing 3 omic pathways from no cognitive impairment (NCI) to AD dementia that differ by their omic constituents. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We first ran four separate linear regressions with neuroticism, depressive symptoms, loneliness, purpose in life as the outcomes, and pseudotime as the predictor, adjusting for age, sex and education. We then ran four separate analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) with Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests to test whether the three multi-omic AD subtypes are differentially associated with the four traits, adjusting for the same covariates. RESULTS: Pseudotime was positively associated (p<0.05) with neuroticism and loneliness. AD subtypes were differentially associated with the traits: AD subtypes 1 and 3 were associated with neuroticism; AD subtype 2 with depressive symptoms; AD subtype 3 with loneliness, and AD subtype 2 with purpose in life. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Three multi-omic brain molecular subtypes of AD dementia differentially share omic features with four psychological risk factors of AD dementia. Our data provide novel insights into the biology underlying well-established associations between psychological traits and AD dementia.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by significant cognitive and functional decline, initially presenting with episodic memory impairment. A thorough neuropsychological assessment is essential for AD diagnosis, particularly in the early stages in which interventions may be more effective. This paper reviews the neuropsychology of Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the cognitive progression of the disease. In the typical forms of AD, episodic memory appears to be the first and foremost affected cognitive domain. As AD progresses, cognitive impairments extend beyond memory to affect various domains such as attention, executive functions, language, and visuospatial abilities. Neuropsychiatric issues, such as depression and anxiety, which often accompany cognitive decline, are also common, especially at the advanced stages of the disease. While episodic memory impairment is the earliest and most prominent feature in typical AD cases, comprehensive assessments, including social cognition and neuropsychiatric evaluations, are crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

Plasma biomarkers are promising tools for the screening and diagnosis of dementia in clinical settings. We analyzed plasma levels of Alzheimer's core biomarkers, neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), through single-molecule Array in 108 patients with Alzheimer's (AD, cerebrospinal fluid with an amyloid+ tau+ neurodegeneration+ profile), 73 patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD, 24 with genetic diagnosis), and 54 controls. The best area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess the discriminative power. Patients with AD had lower Aß42/40 ratios and NfL levels, along with higher levels of p-tau181 and GFAP, compared with FTD patients. Single biomarkers discriminated well between dementia patients and controls: the Aß42/40 ratio (AUC:0.86) or GFAP (AUC:0.83) was found for AD, and the NfL (AUC:0.84) was found for FTD patients. However, a combination of two (NfL with p-tau181, or the GFAP/NfL ratio, AUCs ~0.87) or three biomarkers (NfL, P-tau181, and Aß42/40 ratio, AUC: 0.90) was required to distinguish between AD and FTD. Biomarker profiles were similar across different FTD phenotypes, except for carriers of PGRN mutations, who had higher levels of NfL than C9orf72 expansion carriers. In our series, NfL alone provided the best distinction between FTD and controls, while a combination of two or three biomarkers was required to obtain good discrimination between AD and FTD.

There is growing public awareness and concern regarding dementia risk. In addition, genetic testing is increasingly accessible and is at the point of being integrated into routine clinical practice. As a result, there is a pressing need for treating clinicians to have the appropriate knowledge base to request and consent for diagnostic genetic testing in cognitive clinics. We outline our approach to genetic testing in patients with Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies and vascular cognitive impairment. We discuss when to consider testing, the consenting process, and the interpretation and communication of genetic test results.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is marked by motor symptoms and often accompanied by mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), affecting up to 50% of patients and preceding PD dementia (PDD). Genetic factors may influence this progression, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated genetic factors influencing the progression from PD-MCI to PDD using polygenic risk scores (PRS). A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted using data from the LANDSCAPE study. Multivariable Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and concordance statistics assessed the relationship between PRS and PDD progression. No significant association was found between PD PRS and the risk of developing PDD.

Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) encompasses 2 clinical entities, namely dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia. It is a progressive degenerative brain disorder characterized by dementia, psychosis, and features of parkinsonism. Symptoms fluctuate with time and vary among different individuals. Diagnosis of LBD requires thorough clinical examination as many of its features overlap with other dementia disorders. It is the third most common type of dementia after Alzheimer disease and Vascular dementia. It is characterized by the deposition of Lewy bodies in the brain, which are intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusion bodies with alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin aggregates. There continues to be a debate about the relationship between Parkinson disease and LBD. The latest LBD consortium has set an arbitrary 12-month rule to differentiate LBD from Parkinson disease with dementia. If the patient has Parkinson disease for 12 months or longer before any cognitive impairment is noticed, then the disorder is most likely Parkinson disease with dementia, if the time period is shorter then the disorder is LBD. In most cases of LBD, dementia precedes motor signs, particularly episodes of diminished responsiveness and visual hallucinations.

Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is characterized by a progressive decline in behavioral and cognitive functions, with sleep disorders (SDs) increasingly recognized as one of the noncognitive symptoms. Sleep plays a critical role in the brain, supporting learning and memory, regulating synaptic plasticity, and facilitating waste clearance. However, the mechanisms underlying sleep disturbances in AD remain poorly understood. This review aims to explore these mechanisms and their potential relevance for clinicians managing AD. A systematic search was conducted across multiple sources and databases, using keywords such as "Alzheimer AND sleep disorder", along with terms related to neurodegeneration and sleep disturbances. Of the 1,511 records identified, 18 were included in the final analysis. The findings highlight several mechanisms linking AD and SDs, suggesting a bidirectional relationship. These mechanisms include (i) shared genetic factors; (ii) disruption of the glymphatic system; (iii) circadian system dysregulation; (iv) neuroinflammation; (v) abnormal functional connectivity between related brain regions; and (vi) atrophy in brain regions involved in memory and sleep. In conclusion, the relationship between AD and SDs is complex and bidirectional. Sleep disturbances not only precede the onset of AD but also worsen as the disease progresses. Sleep may, therefore, serve as a promising biomarker for AD, with targeting sleep disturbances offering a potential early therapeutic strategy in managing AD.

Alzheimer's disease refers to a neurological disorder marked by memory loss and cognitive dysfunction caused by the death of brain cells. It is a progressive, devitalizing disease of aging that has skyrocketed in recent years. The disease progresses gradually, with symptoms including forgetfulness, difficulty with language or communication, disorientation, mood swings, and changes in behaviour. Unani medicine, being an older system of medicine, does not mention Alzheimer's disease as such since the name was coined only in 1907 AD. The Unani medical literature has, however, described the existence of Nisyān with signs and symptoms similar to those of Alzheimer's disease. The renowned Unani scholars have not only mentioned the aetiology and pathogenesis of Nisyān but also designed a specific line of treatment. This study attempts to present the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and Nisyān, along with an exploration of potential treatment options available in Unani medicine.

Symptoms related to sleep, weight, and endocrine dysfunction are common in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). The cause of these symptoms is not known, but they may be related to hypothalamic neurodegeneration. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies using MRI or PET imaging to examine the hypothalamus in AD or LBD. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted using the standardised mean difference (SMD) in hypothalamic volume, and a narrative synthesis was used to examine associations between hypothalamic imaging and sleep, weight, and endocrine function. We screened 8891 articles which identified 22 studies for inclusion in the narrative synthesis of which 6 were suitable for meta-analysis. 86 % had a low to moderate risk of bias. People with mild-moderate AD had a smaller hypothalamus compared to controls (SMD=-0.49[-0.86,-0.13],p = 0.018;I(2)=67 %[21.5 %-86.1 %];n = 454(AD),715(controls)), and had differences in hypothalamic metabolism and connectivity. Two studies in LBD found lower grey matter and serotonin transporter binding in the hypothalamus compared to controls. Hypothalamic differences in AD were associated with male sex, worse sleep, lower bone mineral density and plasma levels of sex hormones. Body mass index was not associated with hypothalamic volume in AD, although further studies are needed. Lower hypothalamic volume is seen in AD and this may influence sleep and endocrine function. A better understanding of hypothalamic degeneration may help elucidate how pathology relates to symptoms in AD and LBD and reveal new targets for intervention.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Dementia is not a single disease but an umbrella term that encompasses a range of symptoms, such as memory loss and cognitive impairments, which are severe enough to disrupt daily life. One of the most common forms of dementia is Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative condition influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent research has highlighted diet as a potential modifiable risk factor for AD. Decades of research have explored the role of dietary patterns, including the Mediterranean Diet (MD) and its components, in neuroprotection and cognitive health. Systematic review examines studies investigating the impact of the Mediterranean Diet, Mediterranean-like diets, the Nordic Diet (ND), dietary intake patterns, and specific components such as extra virgin olive oil and rapeseed oil on cognitive function, disease onset, and progression in AD and dementia. METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, the Directory of Open Access Journals, and the Social Science Research Network was conducted independently by two reviewers using predefined search terms. The search period included studies from 2006 to 2024. Eligible studies meeting the inclusion criteria were systematically reviewed, yielding 88 studies: 85 focused on the MD and its relationship to AD and dementia, while only 3 investigated the ND. RESULTS: The findings suggest that adherence to the Mediterranean and Nordic diets is generally associated with improved cognitive function and delayed cognitive decline and that adherence to both these diets can improve cognitive function. Some studies identified that higher legume consumption decreased dementia incidence, while fruits and vegetables, carbohydrates, and eggs lowered dementia prevalence. Most studies demonstrated that high MD or ND adherence was associated with better cognitive function and a lower risk of poor cognition in comparison to individuals with lower MD or ND adherence. However, some studies reported no significant benefits of the MD on cognitive outcomes, while two studies indicated that higher red meat consumption was linked to better cognitive function. CONCLUSION: Despite promising trends, the evidence remains varying across studies, underscoring the need for further research to establish definitive associations between diet and cognitive function. These findings highlight the essential role of dietary interventions in the prevention and management of dementia and AD, therefore offering critical insights into the underlying mechanisms by which the diet may impact brain health.

BACKGROUND: Ultra-processed food consumption is emerging as a risk factor for various cardiometabolic diseases, however its association with dementia and Alzheimer's disease has rarely been explored. OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine whether ultra-processed food consumption is associated with risk of all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease among middle-age and older adults. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: The Framingham Heart Study, a single-site, community-based cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Offspring cohort participants who attended examination cycles 5 (1991-1995) and 7 (1998-2001) at age ≥60 years and who were dementia-free at baseline. MEASUREMENTS: Nutritional information was retrieved from food frequency questionnaires, and ultra-processed food was categorized based on the NOVA system. Participants were followed-up for all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: The study sample included 1,375 participants free of dementia and stroke at baseline (mean age 68 ± 6y, 54 % females). During a mean follow-up of 12.7 ± 6.0 years, 224 and 172 individuals were diagnosed with all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease, respectively. An interaction of ultra-processed food consumption with age was observed with regard to dementia and Alzheimer's disease (p for interaction = 0.02 and 0.007, respectively). Therefore, all analyses were stratified by the median age of 68 years. Among participants who were <68 years of age at baseline, each serving per day of ultra-processed food was associated with 13 % increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (HR = 1.13, 95 % CI:1.03-1.25), and consumption of ≥10 servings/day vs. <10 servings/day of ultra-processed food was associated with a 2.7-fold increase in Alzheimer's disease risk (HR = 2.71, 95 % CI:1.18-6.24), after adjustment for age, sex, education, total energy, metabolic factors and diet quality. The associations with all-cause dementia were less robust, and no significant findings were observed when age at baseline was 68 years or above. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that consumption of ultra-processed food in middle-age may be linked with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. Future clinical studies are warranted to assess whether reduction of ultra-processed food consumption improves brain health.

Within the phenotypic spectrum of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), dementia that is attributed to iatrogenic transmission has increasingly gained scientific attention recently. Newly recognized, this treatment-induced form of dementia may result from exposure to certain medical or surgical procedures. The present review aims to explore the distinct features of acquired dementia encompassing a history of potential exposure and relatively early age of onset, highlighting transmission potential with a rather prion-like pattern. Having reviewed all available relevant literature, dementia of iatrogenic etiology represents a new disease entity that requires an individualized investigation process and poses a great clinical challenge as far as patients with AD, CJD and CAA are concerned. Understanding the underlying pathophysiology of these rare forms of dementia may significantly enhance awareness within clinical field of neurodegenerative diseases and facilitate their prompt management.

INTRODUCTION: A subset of amyloid beta (Aβ)-positive Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is tau-positron emission tomography (PET) negative. We aimed to characterize this subgroup using [(18)F]flortaucipir PET visual read (VR), as this is important for prognosis and selection for therapies. METHODS: Aβ-positive VR tau-PET-negative AD dementia patients (AD A+T-) were compared to tau-PET-positive AD patients (AD A+T+) and control groups (CU A-T-; CU A+T-) included from the Amsterdam-based cohort and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We compared [(18)F]flortaucipir binding in an early- and late-stage tau ROI, atrophy, cognition, and co-pathologies. RESULTS: AD A+T- were older, showed less hippocampal atrophy and slower cognitive decline compared to AD A+T+. In ADNI, AD A+T- showed higher early-stage tau binding compared to both control groups and more late-stage tau compared to CU A-T-, but no tau accumulation over time. DISCUSSION: VR tau-PET-negative AD patients show neurodegenerative and cognitive processes consistent with the AD trajectory, but milder progression compared to tau-PET-positive AD patients. HIGHLIGHTS: We used the novel Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved VR method for defining tau-PET positivity. AD A+T- patients were older and showed less atrophy and cognitive decline than AD A+T+. We did not find convincing evidence of tau accumulation in AD A+T- or copathologies. The group of AD A+T- patients is likely very heterogeneous.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain is prevalent among older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD). Memantine and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ACHEI; donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) are approved for the treatment of dementia symptoms and may also have analgesic properties. However, findings on the clinical utility of these dementia medications for chronic pain treatment are mixed, and little is known about differences in the use of pain medication according to whether an older adult with AD/ADRD is using dementia medications. METHODS: We selected a 20% national sample of Medicare enrollees with a diagnosis of AD/ADRD and chronic pain in 2020. We calculated the odds of having any pain management prescription (opioids, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, gapapentinoids, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), having an opioid prescription, and having a long-term (≥ 90 days) opioid prescription, by dementia medication (none, memantine, ACHEI, or memantine and ACHEI). RESULTS: Among 103,564 patients, 5.5% received a memantine prescription, 14.4% received an ACHEI prescription, and 8.6% received a prescription for both. Over 70% of all patients had a pain management prescription. The percentage of patients who had an opioid prescription ranged from 54.5% for those without a dementia medication prescription to 44.0% for those with a prescription for both memantine and ACHEI. Similarly, the percentage of patients who had a long-term opioid prescription was highest for those without a dementia medication prescription (12.2%) and lowest for those with a prescription for both memantine and ACHEI (8.8%). Having a prescription for memantine only was associated with lower odds of any pain management prescription (odds ratio [OR]: 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88-1.00; p < 0.05). Having a prescription for either memantine (OR: 0.79; 95% CI 0.75-0.84), ACHEI (OR: 0.85; 95% CI 0.82-0.89), or both (OR: 0.75; 95% CI 0.72-0.79) was associated with lower odds of having an opioid prescription (p < 0.05). Lastly, having a prescription for either memantine (OR: 0.85; 95% CI 0.77-0.94), ACHEI (OR: 0.92; 95% CI 0.86-0.98), or both (OR: 0.83; 95% CI 0.77-0.90) was associated with lower odds of having a long-term opioid prescription. DISCUSSION: Older adults with co-occurring AD/ADRD and chronic pain who were on dementia medications had lower odds of being prescribed opioid analgesics. Memantine and ACHEIs should be explored as potential opioid-sparing medications for older adults with AD/ADRD, given their relatively safe profiles. Future studies are needed to examine repurposing dementia medications for pain treatment.

Latin America's diverse genetic landscape provides a unique opportunity to study Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The Multi-Partner Consortium to Expand Dementia Research in Latin America (ReDLat) recruited 2,162 participants with AD, FTD, or as healthy controls from six countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Participants underwent genomic sequencing and population structure analyses were conducted using Principal Component Analysis and ADMIXTURE. The study revealed a predominant mix of American, African, and European ancestries, with an additional East Asian component in Brazil. Variant curation identified 17 pathogenic variants, pathogenic C9orf72 expansion, and 44 variants of uncertain significance. Seventy families showed autosomal dominant inheritance, with 48 affected by AD and 22 by FTD. This represents the first large-scale genetic study of AD and FTD in Latin America, highlighting the need to consider diverse ancestries, social determinants of health, and cultural factors when assessing genetic risk for neurodegenerative diseases.

The mitochondrial cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been portrayed through molecular, cellular, and animal studies; however large epidemiological studies are lacking. This study aimed to explore the association of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn), a marker representative of mtDNA abundance per cell, with risk of incident all-cause dementia, AD, and vascular dementia diagnosis within 17 years and dementia-related blood biomarkers (P-tau181, GFAP, and NfL). Additionally, sex-stratified analyses were completed. In this German population-based cohort study (ESTHER), 9940 participants aged 50-75 years were enrolled by general practitioners and followed for 17 years. Participants were included in this study if information on dementia status and blood-based mtDNAcn measured via real-time polymerase chain reaction were available. In a nested case-control approach, a subsample of participants additionally had measurements of P-tau181, GFAP, and NfL in blood samples taken at baseline. Of 4913 participants eligible for analyses, 386 were diagnosed with incident all-cause dementia, including 130 AD and 143 vascular dementia cases, while 4527 participants remained without dementia diagnosis within 17 years. Participants with low mtDNAcn (lowest 10%) experienced 45% and 65% percent increased risk of incident all-cause dementia and AD after adjusting for age and sex (all-cause dementia: HRadj, 95%CI:1.45, 1.08-1.94; AD: HRadj, 95%CI: 1.65, 1.01-2.68). MtDNAcn was not associated to vascular dementia diagnosis and was more strongly associated with all-cause dementia among women. In the nested case-control study (n = 790), mtDNAcn was not significantly associated with the dementia-related blood biomarkers (P-tau181, GFAP, and NfL) levels in blood from baseline before dementia diagnosis. This study provides novel epidemiological evidence connecting mtDNA abundance, measured via mtDNAcn, to incident dementia and AD at the population-based level. Reduced mitochondrial abundance may play a role in pathogenesis, especially among women.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (ad) patients often experience clinically significant agitation, leading to distress, increased healthcare costs and earlier institutionalisation. Current treatments have limited efficacy and significant side effects. Cannabinoid-based therapies, such as the nabiximols oral spray (Sativex®; 1:1 delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol), offer potential alternatives. We aimed to explore the feasibility and safety of nabiximols as a potential treatment for agitation in ad. METHODS: The 'Sativex® for Agitation & Aggression in Alzheimer's Dementia' (STAND) trial was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, feasibility study conducted in UK care homes. Participants with probable ad and predefined clinically significant agitation were randomised to receive placebo or nabiximols for 4 weeks on an up-titrated schedule, followed by a 4-week observation period. To be considered feasible, we prespecified the following thresholds that needed to be met: randomising 60 participants within 12 months, achieving a ≥ 75% follow-up rate at 4 weeks, maintaining ≥80% adherence to allocation and estimating a minimum effect size (Cohen's d ≥ 0.3) on the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory. This trial is registered with ISRCTN 7163562. FINDINGS: Between October 2021 and June 2022, 53 candidates were assessed; 29 met eligibility criteria and were randomised. No participants withdrew, and adherence was high (100%) and was generally feasible to deliver. The intervention was well tolerated (0 adverse reactions), with no safety concerns reported. INTERPRETATION: Despite significant COVID-19 pandemic related challenges, administering nabiximols through oral mucosa to advanced ad patients with agitation demonstrated feasibility and safety. These findings support a larger confirmatory efficacy trial to evaluate the potential therapeutic efficacy of nabiximols for agitation in ad.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this review is to summarize clinical, radiological and laboratory findings in autoimmune dementia, to help clinicians in promptly identify this elusive condition. RECENT FINDINGS: The rapid advances in the field of autoimmune neurology have led to the discovery of novel antibodies and associated disorders, which are more frequent than previously hypothesized. The correct and prompt identification of cognitive decline of autoimmune origin is vital to ensure early treatment and better outcomes. The diagnosis of autoimmune dementia relies on specific clinical and radiological features and on the detection of specific autoantibodies. Autoantibody specificities predict response to treatment and the occurrence of cancer. In recent years, the differential diagnosis of autoimmune dementia has become more relevant, as the overinterpretation of antibody results, clinical and radiological findings may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of autoimmune dementia, with potential harm to patients due to inappropriate exposure to immunosuppressants. SUMMARY: Autoimmune dementia is a potentially treatable condition and should not be missed in clinical practice given the potential for reversibility with immunotherapy. The diagnosis of autoimmune dementia relies on a comprehensive review of clinical, radiological and laboratory data, and exclusion of other causes of dementia.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) together contribute to almost 90 % of all dementia cases leading to major health challenges of our time with a substantial global socioeconomic burden. While in AD, the improved understanding of Amyloid beta (Aß) mismetabolism and tau hyperphosphorylation as pathophysiological hallmarks has led to significant clinical breakthroughs, similar advances in VaD are lacking. After comparing the clinical presentation, including risk factors, disease patterns, course of diseases and further diagnostic parameters for both forms of dementia, we highlight the importance of shared pathomechanisms found in AD and VaD: Endothelial damage, blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and hypoperfusion inducing oxidative stress and inflammation and thus trophic uncoupling in the neurovascular unit. A dysfunctional endothelium and BBB lead to the accumulation of neurotoxic molecules and Aß through impaired clearance, which in turn leads to neurodegeneration. In this context we discuss possible neuropathological parameters, which might serve as biomarkers and thus improve diagnostic accuracy or reveal targets for novel therapeutic strategies for both forms of dementia.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) comprises several co-occurring vascular and cardiometabolic characteristics and might represent a novel modifiable risk factor for dementia, though findings remain inconsistent. To clarify this, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies investigating the association between MetS with risk of incident all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase and PsycINFO databases (from inception to Feb 19th, 2024) for longitudinal cohort studies investigating the association of MetS with incident all-cause dementia or key subtypes, including Alzheimer's, vascular, Lewy Body or other dementias. Random-effects models were used to estimate pooled hazard ratios (pHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. RESULTS: Of 4,719 studies identified, fourteen studies met the eligibility criteria. These studies combined included 4,345,741 participants who were initially free of dementia. Pooled estimates showed that, compared to participants with no MetS, those with MetS had a significantly greater risk of incident all-cause dementia (4,307,830 participants, 27,708 cases, pHR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.08-1.15, I(2) = 12.0%). No significant association was observed for incident Alzheimer's disease (4,109,436 participants, 14,890 cases, pHR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.72-1.15, I(2): 41.0%) or vascular dementia (4,109,436 participants, 2,642 cases, pHR: 1.40, 95% CI: 0.96-2.06, I(2): 59.0%). Associations remained similar in subgroup analyses restricted to studies reporting results for those aged 65 + years: all-cause dementia (pHR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.00-1.16, I(2): 15.0%), Alzheimer's disease (pHR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.65-1.11, I(2): 0.0%), and vascular dementia (pHR: 1.55, 95% CI: 0.71-3.39, I(2): 75.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that MetS may be an important risk factor for developing dementia, and represent a potential target for prevention. Further studies are needed to understand the influence of MetS on specific dementia subtypes.

BACKGROUND: Agitation in Alzheimer's dementia has a substantial impact on patients, caregivers/family, and healthcare systems. As new evidence surrounding the treatment of agitation emerges, a roundtable of multispecialty experts convened to review published literature (from a PubMed database search on 1 October 2024) and provide evidence-based clinical practice consensus recommendations for the diagnosis and management of agitation in Alzheimer's dementia for US-based primary care providers. AIM: The main objective of this article is to summarize key recommendations from the roundtable on identification, differential diagnosis, current clinical practice, nonpharmacologic interventions, pharmacologic interventions, and treatment and communication considerations for residential care facilities/home care settings and caregivers. RESULTS: Active communication between healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers/family is critical for early recognition, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate management and prevention of agitation. The foundation of treatment always begins with individualized psychoeducation and nonpharmacologic interventions based on the patient's personality, interests, and level of functioning. Pharmacologic interventions are strongly considered when agitated behaviors become highly intense, disturbing, and disruptive or if major safety concerns cannot be otherwise addressed, and only when the healthcare provider is confident that the agitation can be sufficiently managed or mitigated with a pharmacologic intervention possessing a favorable individual risk-benefit profile. While several pharmacologic agents have been studied in high-quality clinical trials for the treatment of agitation in Alzheimer's dementia, brexpiprazole is the only US Food and Drug Administration - approved treatment and it can be prescribed if warranted. Interventions should be continuously evaluated to optimize treatment and monitor and minimize potential side effects. A patient-centered approach that includes a strong partnership with caregivers/family as a vital part of the patient's larger care team is encouraged. CONCLUSION: Following these recommendations for timely detection, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate management of agitation in patients with Alzheimer's dementia is likely to improve outcomes for most patients and caregivers.

BACKGROUND: A proteome-wide association study (PWAS) that integrates proteomic data with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data is a powerful tool for studying Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Existing PWAS analyses of AD often rely on the availability of individual-level proteomic and genetic data of a reference panel. Leveraging summary protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) reference data of multiple AD-relevant tissues is expected to improve PWAS findings of AD dementia. METHODS: We conducted PWAS by integrating publicly available summary pQTL data of three tissues including brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma, with the latest GWAS summary data of AD dementia. For each target protein per tissue, we employed our recently published OTTERS tool to obtain omnibus PWAS p-value, testing whether the genetically regulated protein abundance in the corresponding tissue is associated with AD dementia. Protein-protein interactions and enriched pathways of identified significant PWAS risk genes were analyzed by STRING. The potential causal effects of these PWAS risk genes were assessed by probabilistic Mendelian Randomization analyses. RESULTS: We identified 30 unique significant PWAS risk genes for AD dementia, including 11 for brain, 10 for CSF, and 16 for plasma tissues. Five of these were shared by at least two tissues, and gene MAPK3 was found in all three tissues. We found that 11 of these PWAS risk genes were associated with AD dementia or AD pathology traits in GWAS Catalog; 18 of these were detected by transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex brain tissue; and 25 of these, including 8 out of 9 novel genes, were interconnected within a protein-protein interaction network involving the well-known AD risk gene APOE. These PWAS risk genes were enriched in immune response, glial cell proliferation, and high-density lipoprotein particle clearance pathways. Mediated causal effects were validated for 13 PWAS risk genes (43.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic mechanisms of AD dementia in brain, CSF, and plasma, and provide targets for developing new therapies. This study also demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating summary pQTL and GWAS data for mapping risk genes of complex human diseases.

Art-based interventions for people living with dementia have been successful in improving diverse areas of quality of life and care. Within the spectrum of art-based interventions, poetry has shown an impact on communication, socialization, and the regulation of behavioral outcomes. This scoping review aims to identifying and analyzing how and in what contexts poetry has been used as a form of therapy for people living with dementia and their caregivers. It also looks at the methodology, design, and outcomes. After screening 1106 articles across multiple databases, 23 underwent full-text review, and six were included in the final extraction. Inclusion criteria focused on people living with dementia aged 50+ and/or their family caregivers, encompassing any form of language-based poetry intervention (e.g., written, spoken word). Both completed and ongoing original research reporting intervention outcomes in peer-reviewed articles or certain types of grey literature were considered. The review covers literature published between 1993 and 2023. Additional details on the poetry interventions including collaboration, facilitation, duration, and underlying theory, were also extracted. The findings highlight the effectiveness of poetry interventions for people living with dementia and their caregivers as person-centered activities fostering personhood and social connectedness. Particularly spoken-word poetry-based programs showed positive impacts on participants' self-expression, personhood, and agency. Two main barriers for wider dissemination were identified. First, methodology and outcome reporting conventions in some extracted studies diverge from broader biomedical/health and social science norms. Second, study design and data analysis are not reported in ways that evidence of programs' impact can be assessed and supported. Additionally, there is a lack of literature focused on the development and implementation of poetry-based intervention programs aimed at serving under-represented and minority populations. Recommendations for future projects include multidisciplinary collaborations, diversifying methodological approaches, and attention to cross-cultural approaches to program development and implementation.

To our knowledge, no reports have described nonhuman primate (NHP) models of frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) that do not depend on an overexpression paradigm. Based on our recent success in generating single human MAPT knock-in mouse models of FTDP-17, we describe the experimental basis for generating knock-in marmoset models of FTDP-17. In addition, successful generation of mutant PSEN1 knock-in marmoset models lacking exon 9 (PSEN1-Δ9) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) indicates that we will be able to reconstitute two major pathological features of AD, i.e., amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, in an accelerated manner by combining these models.

Ischemic stroke and vascular cognitive impairment, caused by a sudden arterial occlusion or more subtle but protracted vascular insufficiency, respectively, are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide with limited therapeutic options. Innate and adaptive immunity have long been implicated in neurovascular injury, but recent advances in methodology and new experimental approaches have shed new light on their contributions. A previously unappreciated dynamic interplay of brain-resident, meningeal, and systemic immune cells with the ischemic brain and its vasculature has emerged, and new insights into the frequent overlap between vascular and Alzheimer pathology have been provided. Here, we critically review these recent findings, place them in the context of current concepts on neurovascular pathologies and Alzheimer's disease, and highlight their impact on recent stroke and Alzheimer therapies.

INTRODUCTION: Brain-derived tau (BD-tau) measures tau specifically from brain-derived sources and can differentiate Alzheimer's disease (AD) from other diseases. This study investigated BD-tau as a potential biomarker of treatment effect. METHODS: BD-tau and phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217) levels were measured after treatment with an anti-tau drug in AD and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) clinical trials, and the association with total tau (t-tau), p-tau181(,) and amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) was examined. RESULTS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) BD-tau decreased after treatment in the AD cohort; however, no change was seen in bvFTD or p-tau217 in either cohort. CSF t-tau and p-tau181 correlated with BD-tau in AD (r = 0.9113 and 0.7746, p < 0.0001) and bvFTD (r = 1.0 and r = 0.79, p < 0.05). CSF BD-tau did not correlate with serum or plasma BD-tau in bvFTD. DISCUSSION: CSF BD-tau shows potential as a biomarker of treatment effect in AD but not bvFTD. Further research is needed to investigate this effect in blood-based samples and in other neurodegenerative diseases. Trial registration: ACTRN12611001200976, ACTRN12617001218381. HIGHLIGHTS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) brain-derived tau (BD-tau) levels decreased with sodium selenate treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).CSF BD-tau levels did not change with sodium selenate treatment in bvFTD.Baseline CSF BD-tau correlated with CSF total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181) in AD and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD).Baseline serum and plasma BD-tau levels did not correlate with CSF BD-tau in bvFTD.CSF p-tau217 did not change with sodium selenate treatment in AD or bvFTD.

INTRODUCTION: Longitudinal comparative characterisation of dementia syndromes may aid differential diagnosis, prognostication and intervention implementation. METHODS: We compared the behavioural and cognitive characteristics of 84 behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 29 left and 14 right-dominant semantic dementia (SDL and SDR) and 49 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients over a follow-up period of 2.4 ± 1.6 years using the Cambridge Behavioural Inventory Revised (CBI-R) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination third edition (ACE-III). RESULTS: Linear mixed modelling of time effects found progression of all CBI-R domains, aside from sleep, beliefs and mood domains, and all ACE-III domains. Modelling of group effects found that bvFTD had greater symptoms than AD in most CBI-R domains. Notably, SDL and SDR compared differently with AD and bvFTD; whilst SDR did not differ significantly from bvFTD in any CBI-R domain, SDL had less severe symptoms than bvFTD in everyday skills, motivation, sleep and eating habits; whilst SDL had greater disturbances in abnormal behaviour and stereotypic behaviour than AD, SDR had greater disturbances in addition in motivation and eating habits. Motivation, eating habits, abnormal behaviour and stereotypic behaviour were the most frequently different behavioural domains between groups. CONCLUSION: We have shown that the combined, longitudinal use of existing behavioural and cognitive assessments could capture distinct clinical profiles of common and rare dementia syndromes. Our findings also highlight the importance of select behavioural domains such as motivation and the usefulness of separate clinical characterisations of SDL and SDR.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is characterized by significant molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity, which confounds its mechanistic understanding, diagnosis, and effective treatment. In this study, we harness the most comprehensive dataset of paired ante-mortem blood omics, clinical, psychological, and post-mortem brain multi-omics data and neuroimaging to extensively characterize and translate the molecular taxonomy of AD dementia to living individuals. First, utilizing a comprehensive integration of eight complementary molecular layers from brain multi-omics data (N = 1,189), we identified three distinct molecular AD dementia subtypes exhibiting strong associations with cognitive decline, sex, psychological traits, brain morphology, and characterized by specific cellular and molecular drivers involving immune, vascular, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Next, in a significant translational effort, we developed predictive models to convert these advanced brain-derived molecular profiles (AD dementia pseudotimes and subtypes) into blood-, MRI- and psychological traits-based markers. The translation results underscore both the promise of these models and the opportunities for further enhancement. Our findings enhance the understanding of AD heterogeneity, underscore the value of multi-scale molecular approaches for elucidating causal mechanisms, and lay the groundwork for the development of novel therapies in living persons that target multi-level brain molecular subtypes of AD dementia.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are the most common forms of dementia globally. AD is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain, leading to progressive memory loss and cognitive decline, significantly impairing daily life. In contrast, FTD is marked by selective degeneration of the frontal and/or temporal lobes, typically resulting in profound changes in personality and social behavior, speech disorders, and psychiatric symptoms. Numerous studies have found microRNAs (miRNAs)-small, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally-to be dysregulated in AD and FTD. As a result, miRNAs have emerged as promising novel biomarkers for these diseases. This review examines the current understanding of miRNAs in AD and FTD, emphasizing their potential as accessible, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosing these prevalent neurodegenerative disorders.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with an elevated risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). While sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have shown neuroprotective potential, comparative data on their efficacy in dementia prevention remain scarce. METHODS: - We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX database, including 307,103 SGLT2 inhibitor users and 348,686 GLP-1 receptor agonist users with T2DM. Propensity score matching yielded 221,883 pairs with balanced baseline characteristics. The primary outcome was overall dementia incidence, with secondary outcomes including AD, VaD, and all-cause mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a significantly lower incidence of overall dementia compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists (2.7 % vs. 3.6 %; HR, 0.92; 95 % CI, 0.89-0.95). The risk of VaD (HR, 0.89; 95 % CI, 0.84-0.95) and AD (HR, 0.90; 95 % CI, 0.86-0.94) was also reduced with SGLT2 inhibitors. All-cause mortality was lower in the SGLT2 group (3.6 % vs. 4.6 %; HR, 0.95; 95 % CI, 0.92-0.98). No significant difference was observed in other dementia subtypes (HR, 0.96; 95 % CI, 0.91-1.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this large, real-world cohort, SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrated superior efficacy over GLP-1 receptor agonists in reducing the risks of overall dementia, VaD, and AD among patients with T2DM. These findings support the preferential use of SGLT2 inhibitors in mitigating dementia risk in this population, though randomized controlled trials are warranted for confirmation.

The complexity of neurodegenerative disorders necessitates an integrative approach that incorporates morphological, functional, and molecular biomarkers. The advent of highly sensitive single-molecule array (Simoa®) assays has significantly enhanced the accuracy of blood-based biomarker quantification, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181). This study evaluates the diagnostic utility of these biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases. We analyzed data from 279 individuals from the PADUA-CESNE cohort: 120 with Parkinson's disease (PD), 88 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 16 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 11 with multiple system atrophy (MSA), 14 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and 30 cognitively unimpaired controls. NfL levels were significantly lower in PD and AD compared to atypical parkinsonisms and FTD, effectively distinguishing MSA and PSP from controls. NfL also negatively correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores in AD and PD, indicating its association with cognitive decline. Elevated GFAP levels were observed in both PD and AD and inversely correlated with global cognition. Combining GFAP and p-tau181 improved AD differentiation from PD and other parkinsonian disorders, while the integration of all three biomarkers facilitated the distinction between AD and FTD. Notably, lower NfL levels (<20 ng/L) in conjunction with elevated p-tau181 were indicative of AD, whereas NfL levels below 40 ng/L were suggestive of PD. In conclusion, NfL serves as a sensitive indicator of neurodegeneration, albeit with limited specificity. However, by establishing biomarker concentration thresholds and integrating complementary biomarkers, blood-based assays may enhance the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, providing valuable clinical insights.

INTRODUCTION: Clinical characterization of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is challenging due to overlapping neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive profiles between the two conditions. METHODS: We used clinical network analysis to characterize and compare clinical profiles in AD and bvFTD using initial visit data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. RESULTS: The final matched sample included 890 patients per group (AD: mean age ( )= 63.02, standard deviation [SD] = 9.34, 36.4% female; bvFTD: mean age ( )= 62.87, SD = 9.46, 36.52% female). Both networks were densely connected, reflecting comorbidity between neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive scores. Memory performance, hallucinations, and motor disturbance were bridge symptoms in the AD network, whereas elation was the sole bridge symptom in the bvFTD network. DISCUSSION: Distinct networks highlight unique clinical profiles in AD and bvFTD. Treatment of bridge symptoms may relieve overall symptom burden. Findings can advance clinical characterization of AD and bvFTD, leading to development of targeted interventions. HIGHLIGHTS: We compared clinical features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Clinical networks showed comorbidity between neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive manifestations. Clinical networks significantly differed between AD and bvFTD, highlighting unique behavioral and cognitive profiles. Distinct symptoms were important for overall symptom comorbidity. Findings can be used to characterize AD and bvFTD and inform targeted treatment.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) remains one of the most significant neurodegenerative diseases globally, affecting approximately 38.5 million people in 2023. Early identification of individuals at risk of developing AD is essential to managing disease progression and implementing timely interventions. Despite extensive research on predicting individual AD progression and diagnosis conversion, the dynamic and multimodal characterization of AD evolution remains an open challenge. APPROACH: This study introduces a model leveraging multimodal clinical data to capture and predict both population-level and individual trajectories of dementia over extended timescales. We define a Static Dementia Score (SDS) as a metric representing the current state of dementia, with its temporal evolution modeled using a Bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects approach. This method generates a single continuous curve that delineates the average dementia progression pattern across the population. Additionally, our approach allows for patient-specific SDS progression modeling, enabling the prediction of individual dementia trajectories over a specified time horizon. RESULTS: The model was trained on a dataset comprising 5,033 observations, including MP-RAGE MRI scans, cognitive assessments, and demographic data from 883 individuals with at least four observations and stable diagnostic trajectories. Population-level curves produced by our model align with established AD progression trends, capturing key stages of disease evolution. Individual-specific deformation parameters were effective in characterizing personalized disease progression, achieving a theoretical diagnosis prediction accuracy of 0.952±0.013 three years in advance and an AD conversion prediction accuracy of 0.916±0.022 within the same period. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the potential of this approach for AD classification and forecasting disease progression. These results emphasize its utility for clinicians and researchers in detecting atypical disease trajectories early in patients with longitudinal follow-up, enhancing decision-making and therapeutic planning.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Older adults with dementia are particularly vulnerable to antipsychotic side effects. Brexpiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, is approved in a number of countries for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. This pooled analysis aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of brexpiprazole in this patient population. METHODS: Data were included from three Phase 3, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and a Phase 3, 12-week, active-treatment extension trial in participants with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Safety outcomes included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), weight change, suicidality, extrapyramidal symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction. Two datasets were considered: a 12-week dataset that pooled data from the three randomized trials for brexpiprazole 0.5-3 mg/day and placebo, and a 24-week dataset that combined data from the parent randomized trial and the extension trial for brexpiprazole 2-3 mg/day. RESULTS: Over 12 weeks, 335/655 (51.1%) participants on brexpiprazole and 178/388 (45.9%) participants on placebo reported ≥ 1 TEAE, which led to discontinuation in 41 (6.3%) and 13 (3.4%) participants, respectively. Headache was the only TEAE with incidence ≥ 5% (brexpiprazole, 50 [7.6%] participants; placebo, 36 [9.3%] participants). The incidences of cerebrovascular TEAEs (brexpiprazole, 0.5%; placebo, 0.3%), cardiovascular TEAEs (3.7%; 2.3%), extrapyramidal symptom-related TEAEs (5.3%; 3.1%), and somnolence/sedation TEAEs (3.7%; 1.8%) were generally similar between treatment groups. Six (0.9%) participants on brexpiprazole and 1 (0.3%) participant on placebo died; causes of death were not considered related to brexpiprazole and were generally in line with those expected in Alzheimer's disease. Over 24 weeks, 110/226 (48.7%) participants on brexpiprazole reported ≥ 1 TEAE, which led to discontinuation in 19 (8.4%) participants. Headache was the only TEAE with incidence ≥ 5% (18 [8.0%] participants). No participants died during the extension trial. Over 12 and 24 weeks, mean changes in weight, suicidality, and extrapyramidal symptoms were minimal, with no worsening of cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Considering pooled data from > 1000 participants on brexpiprazole or placebo, brexpiprazole appears to be generally well tolerated for up to 24 weeks in participants with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. STUDY REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01862640, NCT01922258, NCT03548584, NCT03594123.

BACKGROUND: Body composition abnormalities are associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease-related dementia (ADRD). However, the specific link between osteosarcopenic adiposity (OSA), cardiovascular health (CVH), and ADRD is underexplored. This study examined the association between OSA and ADRD to determine whether optimal CVH could modify this association. METHODS: We analyzed data from 152 028 UK Biobank participants. OSA-related body composition abnormalities include low bone mineral density, low muscle mass/grip strength, and high body fat percentage. CVH was assessed using the Life's Essential 8 questionnaire. High and low CVH corresponded to the lowest and highest cardiovascular disease risks, respectively. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for ADRD were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. A secondary analysis included 14 750 participants with brain magnetic resonance imaging data to explore the role of brain structure in the association between OSA and the incidence of ADRD. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 14.1 years, 2628 participants (1.73%) developed ADRD. Compared with participants with no body composition abnormalities, the adjusted HRs for ADRD risk for those with 1, 2, and 3 abnormalities were 1.04 (95% CI, 0.95-1.14), 1.17 (95% CI, 1.04-1.31), and 1.46 (95% CI, 1.11-1.92), respectively. We found a significant addictive interaction between CVH and abnormal body components, with a relative excess risk due to interaction (95% CI) of -1.34 (95% CI, -2.11 to -0.57). Gray matter in the hippocampus could mediate these associations, with a mediation proportion of 17.3% (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: OSA components are positively associated with the risk of ADRD. Maintaining optimal CVH status may mitigate ADRD risk in individuals with OSA.

Metabolomics provide a promising tool for understanding dementia pathogenesis and identifying novel biomarkers. This study aimed to identify amino acid biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Vascular Dementia (VD). By amino acid metabolomics, the concentrations of amino acids were determined in the serum of AD and VD patients as well as age-matched healthy controls. Several differences in the concentration of amino acids were observed in AD patients compared to both healthy controls and VD patients. However, no significant distinction was found between healthy controls and VD patients. Considering comorbidities, cystine levels were higher in AD than in VD among non-diabetic patients, but not in those with diabetes. Notably, creatine, spermidine, cystine, and tyrosine demonstrated favorable results in decision curve analyses and good discriminative performances, suggesting their potential for clinical application. These fundings give novel perspectives of serum amino acids for predicting metabolic pathways in AD and VD pathogenesis.

IMPORTANCE: Recent data point to the impact of non-traditional environmental and social factors on Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias (ADRD) mortality. Our study aimed to determine the extent to which antecedent air pollution, social vulnerability, and geospatial features in the environment associate with ADRD mortality. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study conducted across the mainland United States. County level Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), particulate matter air pollution (PM(2.5)) were linked to ADRD mortality. Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) was used for delineating and characterizing "bumps" or spikes in mortality. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were used to rank variables by predictivity and association with directional changes in ADRD mortality. EXPOSURES: PM(2.5) data was acquired from 1 × 1 km spatial grids using aerosol optical depth from the Atmospheric Analysis Composition Group at Washington University St. Louis. SVI was acquired from the CDC's ATSDR Data, which is a composite index scale that characterizes socio-environmental vulnerability. Google Street View imagery coupled with deep learning computational techniques was used to extract features of neighborhood level environment characteristics from across the United States. RESULTS: There was a significant interaction effect between PM(2.5) and SVI on ADRD mortality (β = 31.100, p < 0.001). Two clusters of elevated ADRD mortality were identified: counties with high PM(2.5) and SVI (HH) and with low PM(2.5) and SVI (LL). Analysis of LL subset revealed associations between ADRD mortality and specific SVI subdomains, as well as built environment variables. Geospatial mapping indicated a split in these clusters along northern and southern latitudes, with differences in temperature and sunlight intensity (p < 0.001) rather than urbanization driving the distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Ambient air pollution interacts with SVI to influence ADRD mortality rates. Our findings support a role for non-traditional factors including elements of the built environment, geographical location, and natural environmental exposures contributing to ADRD mortality.

BACKGROUND: Previous trials have shown improvements in both apathy and cognition with methylphenidate (MPH). OBJECTIVES: To assess whether changes in apathy correlated with changes in cognition in the Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2 (ADMET 2). PARTICIPANTS: Mild to moderate AD patients with clinically significant apathy randomized to MPH (20 mg/day) or placebo for 6 months. MEASUREMENTS: Apathy was measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-apathy (NPI-A) domain. Cognition was measured using the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Hopkins Verbal Learning (immediate [HVLT-I], delayed [HVLT-D] recall), Digit Span (Forward [DF], Backward [DB]), Trail Making (TMT-A, TMT-B), Action Verbal Fluency (AV), Category Fluency (CF), and the Short Boston Naming Test (BNT). DESIGN: Linear mixed models included cognitive change scores as dependent variables and time, treatment, change in NPI-A and the interaction between treatment and change in NPI-A as independent variables, which were additionally adjusted for baseline NPI-A and cognitive scores, age, sex, level of education and presence of diabetes. RESULTS: 199 participants (66 % male) were included (98-MPH, 101-placebo). Among all participants, worsening CF was associated with worsening apathy (-0.15 (0.05), p = .003). In addition, change in HVLT-I was associated with the interaction between changes in apathy and treatment (-0.31 (0.07), p = 0.0000158). CONCLUSION: Changes in apathy are mostly independent of cognitive changes and apathy response to MPH may be independent from cognition. These results are consistent with the view that apathy as a syndrome is related to but distinct from cognition.

BackgroundThe prevalence of individuals living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other forms of dementia is globally increasing. Four out of nine international clinical guidelines recommend non-pharmacological cognitive interventions to enhance cognition, independence, and wellbeing. However, the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation (CR) and cognitive training (CT) for individuals with MCI and AD and other forms of dementia is still debatable, often due to significant heterogeneity among studies.ObjectiveThis study aims to assess the effectiveness of CT and CR in these populations.MethodsFollowing PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive literature search across databases including OVID, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus, identifying randomized controlled trials and non-randomized pre-post intervention studies. The Bayesian meta-analysis focused on pre-post changes in global cognition, quality of life, everyday functioning, and depression, avoiding comparisons with control groups to reduce heterogeneity (PROSPERO: CRD42022365038).ResultsThe search yielded 6075 results, with 40 studies meeting inclusion criteria, encompassing 50 independent trials. CT and people with AD and other dementias are the best represented intervention and population, respectively. CT was more effective in improving global cognition in individuals with AD and other dementias, and paper-and-pencil and face-to-face formats yielded greater benefits. The analysis showed a significant susceptibility to bias among the studies.ConclusionsLimitations in outcome measure (e.g., MMSE) suggest the need for more sensitive assessments, especially for MCI. Future research should explore broader aspects of wellbeing and investigate the potential of CR. Policymakers are encouraged to consider these findings when designing cognitive interventions for this population.

INTRODUCTION: The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementia worldwide underscores the urgent need for effective interventions, particularly for managing neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) such as sleep disturbance. This review explores the emerging role of Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonists (DORA) in addressing sleep disturbance in patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search identified four relevant publications between 2014 and 2024, detailing the use of DORA medications, including suvorexant and lemborexant, in patients with Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: Findings suggest that suvorexant may improve total sleep time (TST), wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE) in Alzheimer's patients with insomnia. Lemborexant demonstrated potential in improving circadian rhythm parameters, particularly in patients with irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder (ISWRD). Safety profiles of DORA medications appeared favorable, with mild to moderate adverse events reported. However, concerns over potential adverse events, such as falls, underscore the need for careful monitoring. CONCLUSION: While the evidence suggests promise for DORA medications in addressing sleep disturbance in Alzheimer's disease, limitations in study populations and duration highlight the need for further investigation. Future clinical trials should aim for broader inclusion criteria, encompassing diverse dementia subtypes and severity levels, to enhance generalizability. Additionally, longer-term trials are essential to assess the sustained efficacy and safety of DORA interventions in this vulnerable population.

The study aimed to diagnose of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) based on brain functional connectivity features extracted via resting-state Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, and subsequently developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, Coherence-CNN, for classification. First, a publicly available dataset of EEG resting state-closed eye recordings containing 36 AD subjects, 23 FTD subjects, and 29 cognitively normal (CN) subjects was used. Then, coherence metrics were utilized to quantify brain functional connectivity, and the differences in coherence between groups across various frequency bands were investigated. Next, spectral clustering was used to analyze variations and differences in brain functional connectivity related to disease states, revealing distinct connectivity patterns in brain electrode position maps. The results demonstrated that brain functional connectivity between different regions was more robust in the CN group, while the AD and FTD groups exhibited various degrees of connectivity decline, reflecting the pronounced differences in connectivity patterns associated with each condition. Furthermore, Coherence-CNN was developed based on CNN and the feature of coherence for three-class classification, achieving a commendable accuracy of 94.32% through leave-one-out cross-validation. This study revealed that Coherence-CNN demonstrated significant performance for distinguishing AD, FTD, and CN groups, supporting the disorder of brain functional connectivity in AD and FTD.

IntroductionThe global rise in dementia presents significant challenges for healthcare systems. While Alzheimer's disease (AD) dominates dementia care, people with non-Alzheimer's dementias (non-AD), such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), vascular dementia (VD), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), often have distinct and unmet healthcare needs.AimThis systematic review aimed to summarise evidence on healthcare utilisation (HCU) patterns and factors affecting care among people living with non-AD dementias.MethodsFollowing a PROSPERO-registered protocol (CRD42024568391), comprehensive searches of Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Global Health, PsycINFO, and PubMed were conducted in February and June 2024. Peer-reviewed English-language studies reporting on HCU or its determinants in DLB, FTD, VD, or PDD were included. Reviews, case reports, grey literature, and studies without subtype-specific data were excluded. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.ResultsThirty-one studies (16 cohort; 10 cross-sectional, 4 case-description, and 1 chart review) were included. HCU varied by dementia subtype and was influenced by sociodemographic, cognitive, and clinical factors. Compared with AD, non-AD dementias had higher healthcare use and costs. PDD showed the highest inpatient, outpatient, and skilled nursing care use, driven by severe cognitive decline. DLB was linked to unplanned hospital admissions and frequent ambulance use, often due to falls and pneumonia. FTD resulted in extended hospital stays related to behavioural symptoms, while VD incurred high costs due to chronic comorbidities and long-term care needs.ConclusionPeople with non-AD dementias have greater and distinct healthcare needs. Future research should develop standardised measures and tailored interventions to address their complex socioeconomic and clinical requirements.

BACKGROUND: Cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, increase the risk of dementia. However, the correlation between CMDs and dementia in different subgroups and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms linking CMDs with dementia warrant further investigation. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included a total of 287,748 individuals from the UK Biobank. The outcome measures included all-cause dementia (ACD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD). Cox regression models and subgroup analyses were used to assess the association between CMD status and dementia, while mediation analysis was evaluated potential roles of inflammatory/metabolic markers in the observed associations. RESULTS: Compared with those without CMD, those with CMD multimorbidity had an elevated risk of ACD (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.27, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.95-2.63), AD (HR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.13-1.97), and VD (HR: 3.70, 95% CI: 2.93-4.69). According to the subgroup analyses, the positive correlations between CMDs and ACD, as well as AD, were stronger in individuals who were under the age of 60 or female. Mediation analysis indicated that neutrophils mediated 2.43% of the association of CMDs with ACD, while glucose and hemoglobin A1c mediated 9.22% and 11.85% of the association of CMDs with ACD, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study further expands the research on cardiometabolic multimorbidity and dementia, highlighting the need for focused attention on specific populations, such as younger individuals and women. Additionally, inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers, as potential mediators, provide critical insights into the complex pathophysiological mechanisms.

Pathophysiological differences separating small vessel disease (SVD) from Alzheimer's disease (AD) may alter treatment approach. Investigating peak-arterial and late-capillary perfusion may differentiate SVD from AD. 14 Subjects with MoCA scores of 11-24 were divided into 2 groups. Group one: 6 AD likely subjects positive for 1 or 2 copies of APOE 4+. Group two: 8 SVD likely subjects APOE-. Group three: 7 age-matched controls (MoCA 26-30). All underwent 3D PASL MRI, FLAIR, and SWI axial MRI. Arterial phase peak amplitude and latency, late capillary inflow/clearance rates, and anatomic abnormalities quantitated using microhemorrhage count, Fazekas, Koedam, and Schelton scales were compared. Arterial perfusion demonstrated no statistical differences among SVD, AD, and controls, suggesting normal arterial flow. Late phase perfusion showed significant localized reduction in capillary flow/clearance rates in SVD and AD compared to controls. Absent arterial phase but significant capillary inflow/clearance differences from controls suggest SVD and AD share common impaired blood-brain barrier origins.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia is a set of acquired and progressive neuropsychiatric disorders. The most common types of dementia include Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Early intravital diagnosis of both types of dementia is difficult. Both molecular and neuroimaging markers are important for the diagnosis of different types of dementia. METHODS: This review employed freely accessible databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect, using keywords such as molecular parameters, neuroimaging factors, dementia, FTD, Alzheimer's disease, and fMRI. RESULTS: Among the molecular markers of dementia, there are parameters common to its various types and enabling their differentiation. These parameters include both genetic and biochemical factors. Markers include genetic factors that help differentiate AD (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2) from FTD (e.g., TARDBP, FUS, MAPT). Simultaneously, there are important biochemical parameters differentiating AD (amyloid-beta (Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles) from FTD (TDP-43, FUS, and different forms of tau protein aggregates). Currently, there is growing interest in neuroimaging studies in the differential diagnosis of dementia. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging enables the quantification and localization of Aβ deposits in the brain through the selective binding of the Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) ligand. This method has become the standard in AD diagnostics. In the context of magnetic resonance imaging studies, it is worth noting the search for structural differences between AD (mainly affecting the temporal lobe, including the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, and the parietal lobe) and FTD (primarily involving the prefrontal cortex, anterior temporal lobes, and subcortical structures, as well as exhibiting an anteroposterior gradient of atrophy). However, the method of the future appears to be functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), especially since functional changes precede structural changes in the development of dementia. DISCUSSION: The review encompasses the basic diagnostic criteria for AD and FTD dementia, as well as molecular and neuroimaging parameters important for the intravital diagnosis of these dementias. It seems that the use of fMRI can contribute to both early diagnosis and early introduction of targeted treatment in developing dementia. Although it is not yet widely used clinically, its diagnostic value is increasingly recognized. CONCLUSION: The benefits of fMRI studies complementing molecular markers in the diagnosis of dementia were highlighted.

Lecanemab and donanemab were approved in Japan in September 2023 and September 2024, respectively, for the treatment of patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Evaluating the efficacy of these drugs requires demonstrating a clinically meaningful delay in symptom progression while ensuring an acceptable safety profile. This paper describes the efficacy assessment in the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency's (PMDA) review, focusing on clinical endpoints, biomarker evaluations, and the role of minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in benefit-risk assessment. At present, the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), which assesses both cognitive and functional decline, is one of the most recommended primary endpoints in confirmatory trials. Time-to-progression analysis should be also conducted to support clinical significance. Biomarker evaluations, particularly amyloid beta (Aβ) reduction, should be included as secondary endpoints to confirm the mechanism of action. Though biomarker assessments showed significant Aβ reduction for both anti-amyloid therapies, no direct correlation with clinical outcomes was observed, limiting their use as surrogate endpoints. Therefore, the MCID for clinical symptom progression suppression cannot be inferred based on Aβ reduction. Safety evaluation focused on amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs), a key risk associated with anti-Aβ antibody treatments. Under the condition in which ARIA risk is managed through magnetic resonance imaging monitoring and predefined risk mitigation measures, PMDA considers the benefit-risk balance of these anti-amyloid therapies are favorable. While regulatory approval does not require meeting predefined MCID thresholds, it is based on a comprehensive benefit-risk assessment. For regulatory approval, future drugs will be required to demonstrate a benefit-risk balance equivalent to or more favorable than that of the approved anti-Aβ antibody drugs. HIGHLIGHTS: Lecanemab and donanemab were approved in Japan for early Alzheimer's disease in 2023 and 2024, respectively.Drug efficacy was considered clinically meaningful after comprehensive evaluation.Biomarker evaluation, including amyloid beta (Aβ), is crucial to support the intended mechanism of action.Aβ reduction did not correlate with the suppression of clinical symptom progression in individual cases.No biomarker is validated as a surrogate, and minimal clinically important difference cannot be inferred from Aβ reduction.

Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second leading cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD). In comparison to AD, there is a decline in the incidence of VaD due to recent improvements in cardiovascular risk factors. Brain hypoperfusion and hypoxia due to vascular pathologies have been postulated as the primary disease mechanism of VaD. However, other factors such as neuroinflammation may also contribute to the development of VaD. Non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors have been attributed to VaD. The clinical features overlapping between AD and VaD create significant challenges for physicians. Newly developed biomarkers may potentially help differentiate VaD from other forms of dementia. Unlike AD, there is no Food and Drug Administration-approved drug or device for treating VaD. Current treatment options mainly target symptoms rather than slowing the development or progression of VaD. There are ongoing research studies testing the efficacy of various therapeutic strategies for VaD. In this narrative review, we will summarise current findings on epidemiology, attributed risk factors and disease mechanisms, as well as emphasise the importance of optimising lifestyle modifications and comorbid condition management in preventing or slowing down the development of VaD. Finally, current therapies and ongoing research studies of novel therapeutic interventions such as stem-cell therapy and neuromodulation are highlighted.

This case report explores the therapeutic potential of lymphovenous bypass (LVB) surgery performed at the neck in neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. The subject is a 58-year-old woman who was previously healthy but began experiencing unexplained memory decline and frequent disorientation in the past 7 years, leading to an AD diagnosis. Despite ongoing pharmaceutical therapy, her symptoms progressed to severe dementia accompanied by behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Her Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores were both 0/30, and (18) F-AV-45 PET/CT revealed abnormal brain amyloid load. For salvage therapy, she underwent LVBs on her neck bilaterally. Postoperatively, she got better MMSE and MoCA scores with dramatic improvement in communication and activity. (18) F-AV-45 PET/CT scans 4 months after surgery indicated a reduction in abnormal brain amyloid deposits. This case report highlights the potential effectiveness of LVB surgery in reducing brain amyloid load and attenuating cognitive impairment and BPSD. Further research with animal experiments and clinical trials is necessary to confirm these findings.

INTRODUCTION: Agitation is a common and disruptive syndrome in dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brexpiprazole was recently approved for this agitation of AD dementia and is the only therapy approved for this indication. AREAS COVERED: The authors review the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, and pharmacodynamics of brexpiprazole. Phase 2/3 and Phase 3 studies of brexpiprazole for the treatment of agitation in dementia due to AD are described. These studies demonstrated efficacy and safety for the 2 mg/d and 3 mg/d doses. Agitation reduction from baseline was significantly greater in the active treatment groups compared to the participants on placebo as measured by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, the primary outcome. Treatment benefit was demonstrated on the Clinician Global Impression - Severity, the key secondary outcome. Safety and tolerability were comparable in drug and placebo arms of the studies. EXPERT OPINION: Approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of brexpiprazole for the treatment of agitation in dementia due to AD is an important milestone and regulatory precedent. This is the first approval for the treatment of any neuropsychiatric syndrome of AD. Brexpiprazole has a 'black box' warning for its use in psychosis caused by dementia due to an observed increase in mortality when using this class of antipsychotic agents in patients with dementia. Post-marketing surveillance will be key to understanding the safety profile of brexpiprazole. Brexpiprazole may be prioritized over the 'off label' use of other potential treatments for agitation.

Generally, when discussing vascular diseases of the brain, practitioners refer to diseases of the large (cervicocephalic) and small (perforating) arteries, requiring a differentiated approach to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. The anatomical and functional unity of the cardiovascular system makes this approach quite arbitrary. Unfortunately, it often escapes attention that the most important component of the cardiovascular system (heart) and its diseases play an important, often dominant role in the development of cerebrovascular disorders, including cognitive impairment and dementia. This paper presents a literature review spanning a 50-year search depth. A literature search was conducted in the eLibrary.ru, CyberLeninka, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases using the key terms «myocardial infarction», «heart failure», «myocardial disease», «cognitive impairment», and «dementia». Current evidence suggests a much broader understanding of the pathogenesis of a condition that was dubbed «cardiogenic dementia» almost half a century ago. The mechanisms underlying the development of encephalopathy in myocardial diseases include chronic brain hypoperfusion, chronic low-intensity inflammation, oxidative stress, damage to the blood-brain barrier, and hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system.

INTRODUCTION: Marital status is a potential risk/protective factor for adverse health outcomes. This study tested whether marital status was associated with dementia risk in older adults. METHODS: Participants (N = 24,107; Mean(age )= 71.79) were from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Cox regressions tested the association between baseline marital status and clinically ascertained dementia over up to 18 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Compared to married participants, widowed (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.67-0.79), divorced (HR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.59-0.73), and never-married participants (HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.52-0.71) were at lower dementia risk, including for Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia. The associations for divorced and never married remained significant accounting for demographic, behavioral, clinical, genetic, referral source, participation, and diagnostic factors. The associations were slightly stronger among professional referrals, males, and relatively younger participants. DISCUSSION: Unmarried individuals may have a lower risk of dementia compared to married adults. The findings could indicate delayed diagnoses among unmarried individuals or challenge the assumption that marriage protects against dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: Widowed, divorced, and never-married older adults had a lower dementia risk, compared to their married counterparts. Unmarried older adults were also at a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia, with a pattern of mixed findings for frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and no associations with risk of vascular dementia or mild cognitive impairment. All unmarried groups were at a lower risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. There was some evidence of moderation by age, sex, and referral source. However, stratified analyses showed small differences between groups, and most interactions were not significant, suggesting that the role of marital status in dementia tends to be similar across individuals at different levels of dementia risk due to education, depression, and genetic vulnerability.

INTRODUCTION: Red blood cells (RBCs) are crucial for oxygen delivery to active tissues and endure significant mechanical forces in the microcirculatory bed. The enrichment of mechanosensitive Piezo1 channels, linked to the cytoskeleton, aids RBCs in navigating the narrow capillaries. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), impaired brain microcirculation may necessitate enhanced Piezo1 function in RBCs. METHODS: With micropipette aspiration and flow cytometry technics, we evaluated, using the specific Piezo1 agonist Yoda1, AD-related alterations in the biomechanical properties of RBCs from cognitively healthy patients (HC) and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. RESULTS: We show that beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides alter the biomechanical properties of RBCs. We observed significantly higher Yoda1-induced calcium responses in RBCs in individuals with MCI and AD compared to RBCs from age-matched HC. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Yoda1-induced Ca(2+) flux through Piezo1 channel emerges as a measurable indicator associated with and improves the detection of AD-related dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: Piezo1 channels aid the navigation of red blood cells (RBCs) through narrow capillaries. Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients show increased Yoda1-induced activation of Piezo1 in RBCs. Incorporation of Yoda1-induced Piezo1 readouts improved the detection of AD-related dementia. Investigating Yoda1-induced Piezo1 activity associated with early AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are two prevalent forms of dementia. VaD is linked to cerebrovascular lesions, such as those from white matter ischemia and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, which can also occur in AD. Nitric oxide (NO) regulates cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the central nervous system. Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist approved for AD treatment. This study investigated the efficacy and molecular mechanism of MN-08, a novel memantine nitrate, in one VaD model (2VO) and two AD models (APP/PS1 mice and Aβ1-42-induced mice). MN-08 increased CBF, ameliorated cognitive and memory functions in VaD and AD, and was more effective than memantine. MN-08 increased the survival rate of CA1 neurons and mitigated white matter lesions and axonal damage. Moreover, MN-08 protected neurons from OGD-induced loss and promoted axonal outgrowth in the hippocampus by upregulating phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK3β), and high-molecular-weight neurofilaments (p-NFH). The beneficial effects of MN-08 were attenuated by carboxy-PTIO, a potent NO scavenger, suggesting that MN-08-derived NO may alleviate cognitive impairment from cerebral hypoperfusion. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that MN-08 is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of dementia including VaD and AD.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early differentiation of these disorders is crucial for managing core symptoms; however, existing biomarkers remain insufficient. DLB shares motor and cognitive symptoms with Parkinson's disease (PD), and both are classified as synucleinopathies due to abnormal α-synuclein aggregation. Although α-synuclein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, it is also abundant in erythrocytes. Recent studies suggest a potential link between erythrocyte-derived α-synuclein and synucleinopathy pathology. Additionally, we previously reported that both erythrocytes and circulating medium and large extracellular vesicles (m/lEVs) in plasma from healthy subjects contain full-length and C-terminally truncated α-synuclein. In this study, we found that erythrocyte α-synuclein levels were significantly lower in DLB compared to AD, PD and healthy controls. Furthermore, α-synuclein levels in circulating m/lEVs were elevated in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. These findings provide new insights into the role of peripheral α-synuclein and suggest its potential utility as a diagnostic marker for DLB. While further validation is needed, erythrocyte-derived α-synuclein may complement nuclear medicine assessments in distinguishing DLB from other neurodegenerative disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Males are disproportionately represented in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Little is known regarding sex differences in cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and motor features of the prodromal stage of DLB. METHODS: We used National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center longitudinal data to examine cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and motor features in 120 males and 23 females 2 years prior to a clinical diagnosis of DLB. RESULTS: Males were more likely than females to present with two or more core DLB clinical features 2 years prior to obtaining a diagnosis of dementia. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, cognitive fluctuations, bradykinesia, and rigidity were more common in males than females. Neuropsychological test performance was similar between groups. DISCUSSION: In prodromal DLB, males exhibit a greater number of core features than females. Core DLB features may fall short in identifying females at risk. Additional work is needed to better understand the clinical profile of prodromal DLB in females. HIGHLIGHTS: There are sex differences in the presentation and course of neurodegenerative disease. Findings from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set suggest there are sex differences in prodromal DLB symptoms. Females were less likely to demonstrate core clinical features of DLB prior to dementia diagnosis. This information can help inform clinical diagnostic criteria for prodromal DLB.

The Recruitment and Retention for Alzheimer's Disease Diversity in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (READD-ADSP) aims to recruit 5000 African participants (Alzheimer's disease [AD] and cognitively unimpaired controls) to generate genomic and biomarker data to better characterize AD neurobiology in Africa from countries that constitute the African Dementia Consortium (AfDC). Blood samples from study participants are separated into fractions and transported to the African Coordinating Centre (ACC: Ibadan, Nigeria), where DNA extraction and long-term biospecimen storage are carried out. Plasma and DNA aliquots are shipped to the John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics, University of Miami (HIHG-UM, Miami, USA) for genotyping, whole genome sequencing, and biomarker analysis. Innovative solutions were devised to mitigate challenges encountered so far. Our biobanking experience in a low-resource setting demonstrates the feasibility of establishing a successful African biobanking network, as an important infrastructure to support Alzheimer's disease and related dementias research in Africa. HIGHLIGHTS: Biobanking is gaining grounds in Africa in studies related to neurological disorders. The Recruitment and Retention for Alzheimer's Disease Diversity in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (READD-ADSP) biobanking network is a new initiative to enhance infrastructure for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) research in Africa through the African Dementia Consortium. The processes of the stepwise creation and development of the READD-ADSP biobanking network have been guided by global best practices and regulatory standards. Challenges were encountered in the process of establishing the READD-ADSP biobank, and home-grown solutions were developed to mitigate the challenges. The READD-ADSP biobanking experience offers lessons to researchers in low-resource settings on how collaborative efforts between the global north and global south enhance cutting-edge team science to tackle ageing-associated brain disorders in low- and middle-income countries.

Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) is a critical deubiquitinating enzyme that is highly expressed in the central nervous system, where it participates in protein degradation and turnover as part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Convincing evidence supports the role of UCH-L1 dysfunction in several neurodegenerative disorders, given its unique position at the crossroad of several aetiopathogenic pathways, including those implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset. Indeed, UCH-L1 depletion correlates with decreased levels of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), with consequent effects on neuroinflammation. Notably, UCH-L1 can affect the level of phosphorylated tau protein, thus contributing to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). In addition, UCH-L1 influences β-Secretase 1 (BACE1) expression, resulting in the abnormal accumulation of amyloid-β plaques in brain parenchyma. These findings underline UCH-L1's centrality in maintaining the homeostasis of protein folding and aggregation, which are significantly impaired in AD and AD-related dementias. Given these assumptions, UCH-L1 is recognized as a potential biomarker for AD, highlighting its relevance in governing the fate of crucial pathological mediators of cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. Herein, we contextualize the involvement of UCH-L1 in different dementia-associated pathways and summarize the state of the art of UCH-L1 as a biomarker for AD diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia varies between rural and urban areas worldwide, with studies reporting mixed patterns. In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to pool the odds ratio (OR) of rural-to-urban prevalence and explored contributing regional and socioeconomic factors. METHODS: We performed comprehensive searches in PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus (January 2000-August 2024) for peer-reviewed studies reporting individual-level AD dementia prevalence comparisons between rural and urban settings. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled OR at a 95 % confidence interval (CI). Prespecified subgroup analyses examined variations by WHO-defined regions, healthcare expenditure, income level, and educational attainment. RESULTS: The meta-analysis incorporated 19 studies (22 datasets, N = 584,863) and found significantly higher AD dementia prevalence in rural areas (pooled OR = 1.247, 95 % CI: 1.059-1.468), with considerable between-study heterogeneity (I(2)=95.5 %). Regional subgroup analyses revealed marked disparities in the Western Pacific (OR = 1.416, 95 % CI: 1.083-1.851) and Southeast Asia (OR = 1.382, 95 % CI: 1.058-1.805), contrasting with nonsignificant findings in the Americas (OR = 0.989, 95 % CI: 0.785-1.247). Socioeconomic stratification showed pronounced rural disadvantages in: (1) lower healthcare expenditure regions (≤7.5 % GDP: OR = 1.268, 95 % CI: 1.043-1.542) and (2) among lower-middle to upper-middle income countries (OR = 1.260, 95 % CI: 1.030-1.542). This disparity attenuated in high-income settings (OR = 1.206, 95 % CI: 0.979-1.486) and in regions with healthcare expenditure >7.5 % GDP (OR = 1.16, 95 % CI: 0.87-1.53). Educational stratification revealed significant rural-urban disparities in regions with lower educational attainment (≤8.1 mean schooling years: OR=1.43, 95 % CI: 1.15-1.79). In contrast, regions with higher educational attainment (>8.1 years) showed no significant difference (OR=1.05, 95 % CI: 0.89-1.25). CONCLUSION: This review provides useful evidence that AD dementia prevalence is higher in rural areas than in urban areas, particularly in resource-limited settings. Our findings call for targeted rural interventions in vulnerable regions and further research into how healthcare infrastructure and education jointly influence AD dementia disparities.

Dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), presents a growing global health challenge characterized by cognitive decline, behavioral changes, and loss of independence. With increasing life expectancy, early diagnosis and improved clinical strategies are urgently needed. This study developed and evaluated machine learning (ML) models to predict AD risk using UK Biobank data, integrating health, genetic, and lifestyle factors. The cohort included 2878 AD cases and 72,366 controls. Among several algorithms, CatBoost performed best (ROC-AUC = 0.773), especially in females. Inputs included ICD-10 codes from 5 years pre-diagnosis, ApoE-ε4 genotype, and large collection of modifiable risk factors. Despite fewer cases, the risk predictive models for vascular dementia (VaD) outperformed the unique AD models. ApoE-ε4 was the most predictive genetic marker, while other common variants had limited utility. Key non-genetic predictors included comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension), education, physical activity, and diet. These findings highlight the value of integrating diverse data sources for dementia risk prediction and emphasize the role of sex-specific modeling and modifiable factors in early, personalized intervention strategies.

Dementia is an increasing disorder, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the cause of 60% of all dementia cases. Despite all efforts, there is no cure for stopping dementia progression. Recent studies reported potential effects of psychedelics on neuroinflammation during AD. Psychedelics by 5HT(2A)R activation can reduce proinflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-α, IL-6) and inhibit neuroinflammation. In addition to neuroinflammation suppression, psychedelics induce neuroplasticity by increasing Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels through Sigma-1R stimulation. This review discussed the effects of psychedelics on AD from both neuroinflammatory and neuroplasticity standpoints.

The incidence of dementia, and specifically, Alzheimer's disease, is higher in women than men, even in middle age, making it possible to rule out lifespan differences between men and women as a contributing factor. Thus, it is plausible that pregnancy experience, which is unique to women, may play a contributing role. In this review, we discuss the different hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), Alzheimer's and vascular dementia, clinical, epidemiological, and preclinical studies that link a history of HDP with dementia. We also present potential mechanisms linking HDP, Alzheimer's, and vascular dementia. Several key symptoms that are shared among the disorders are presented as potential underlying mechanisms that link the adverse pregnancy disorder with the long-term postpartum neurological changes. Further, we present limitations of the existing literature, gaps, and opportunities for further research.

BACKGROUND: A pathogenic variant in the NOTCH3 gene has been identified as the cause of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Studies focusing on variants in NOTCH3 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cohorts have been limited. We aim to screen clinically diagnosed AD and FTD patients with unknown etiology for pathogenic variants in NOTCH3 in the Chinese population. METHODS: This study included early-onset AD and FTD patients consecutively recruited from Xuanwu Hospital. We performed the whole exome sequencing of genomic DNA from the patients screened for rare, nonsynonymous, predicted deleterious NOTCH3 variants. The clinical characteristics of dementia patients with likely pathogenic NOTCH3 variants were described in detail. RESULTS: Three hundred four AD and 261 FTD patients were screened for variants in the NOTCH3 gene. Four cysteine-altering NOTCH3 variants-c.1630C > T,p.(R544C); c.1672C > T,p.(R558C); c.1759C > T,p.(R587C); and c.1918C > T,p.(R640C)-were identified as likely pathogenic variants according to ACMG guidelines. All four patients with cysteine-altering variants were clinically diagnosed with AD or FTD and presented with characteristic clinical manifestations and neuroimaging profiles. Notably, they also showed mild periventricular and deep white matter signal changes on neuroimaging. Our study showed a 0.7% (4/565) occurrence of NOTCH3 pathogenic variants in Chinese early-onset dementia patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings expand the mutational and phenotypic spectrum associated with NOTCH3. NOTCH3 pathogenic variants are present in clinically diagnosed AD and FTD patients. However, the absence of biomarkers to confirm AD or FTD diagnoses limits the interpretation of whether these cases represent comorbid conditions or phenotypic overlaps with CADASIL. Clinical identification of dementia patients with these variants at an early stage is challenging.

Depression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia has become an increasingly recognized public health concern due to its high prevalence and substantial impact on patient outcomes. Despite extensive research having been conducted over the past decades, the precise causal mechanisms and the nature of the relationship between depression and AD dementia remain incompletely understood. This narrative review examines the bidirectional interaction between depression and Alzheimer's disease, emphasizing shared neurobiological pathways, including neurotransmitter dysregulation, neuroinflammation, abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and deficits in neuroplasticity. These mechanisms likely contribute to the acceleration of neurodegeneration in AD and the onset or worsening of depressive symptoms. Current therapeutic approaches remain largely nonspecific, with a lack of targeted therapies that address the unique pathophysiological context of depression in AD. While progress has been made, key research gaps remain, particularly in understanding the complex biological interactions between these two conditions. Future research should focus on identifying specific biomarkers and developing personalized treatment strategies tailored to the neurobiological features of both depression and AD. By addressing these neurobiological mechanisms, we can develop more effective and targeted interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and advancing clinical care for this dual pathology.

INTRODUCTION: Elevated tau (T+) is temporally proximal to dementia onset but less is known about factors influencing T+ onset age and time to dementia after T+ in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used sampled iterative local approximation (SILA) estimated T+ onset age (ETOA) to investigate factors associated with T+ age and time from T+ to dementia onset in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. METHODS: Using SILA-estimated amyloid positivity and T+ onset ages derived from (18)F-Flortaucipir, (18)F-Florbetapir, and (18)F-Florbetaben positron emission tomography and Cox proportional hazards and accelerated failure time models, we analyzed apolipoprotein E (APOE), sex, amyloid burden, age, educational attainment, and literacy associations with ETOA and time from T+ to dementia. RESULTS: Higher amyloid, APOE-ε4, lower education, and lower literacy associated with younger ETOA. Older ETOA and higher amyloid associated with shorter time from T+ to dementia. DISCUSSION: This work highlights the prognostic value of ETOA and the need to better characterize factors contributing to ETOA and dementia onset in AD. HIGHLIGHTS: We applied sampled iterative local approximation (SILA) to Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (18)F-Flortaucipir data, to estimate individuals' age of tau pathology onset (T+) and time from T+ onset to dementia. Higher amyloid, apolipoprotein E ε4, lower education, and lower literacy associated with younger estimated T+ onset age. Older T+ onset age and higher amyloid associated with shorter time from T+ to dementia. Only one individual was observed to remain dementia free 14 years after T+ onset. This work highlights the prognostic value of T+ onset age and the need to better characterize factors contributing to T+ onset age and dementia onset in Alzheimer's disease.

Life satisfaction predicts lower risk of adverse health outcomes, including morbidity and mortality. Research on life satisfaction and risk of dementia has been limited by a lack of comprehensive clinical assessments of dementia. This study builds on previous research examining life satisfaction and clinically ascertained cognitive impairment and dementia. Participants (N = 23070; Mean(age) = 71.83, SD = 8.80) from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center reported their satisfaction with life at baseline. Incident dementia was ascertained through clinical assessment over up to 18 years. Life satisfaction was associated with about 72% lower risk of all-cause of dementia, an association that remained significant accounting for demographic (age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, marital and living status), psychological (depression), clinical (obesity, diabetes, hypertension), behavioral (current and former smoking), and genetic risk (APOE ϵ4) factors. The association was not moderated by demographics, depression, and APOE ε4 status groups. The association was similar when cases occurring in the first five years were excluded, reducing the likelihood of reverse causality. Life satisfaction was also linked to specific causes of dementia, with a reduced risk ranging from about 60% to 90% for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia to > 2-fold lower risk of Lewy Body and frontotemporal dementia. Older adults who were satisfied with their lives were also at 61% lower risk of incident mild cognitive impairment and at 22% lower risk of converting from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Being satisfied with one's life is associated with a lower risk of dementia. Improving life satisfaction could promote better cognitive health and protect against dementia.

Older adults have a higher prevalence of both dementia and epilepsy. Epilepsy and dementia have a bidirectional relationship. Epidemiological studies have shown that elderly patients with epilepsy have approximately twice the risk of developing dementia compared to controls. Conversely, patients with dementia have twice the risk of developing epilepsy compared to controls. Seizure types in older adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy include focal-onset generalized tonic-clonic seizures and focal impaired awareness seizures without convulsions. The differential diagnosis between epilepsy and dementia can be challenging. Temporal lobe epilepsy may be overlooked in patients visiting dementia clinics. In some cases, temporal lobe epilepsy with frequent seizures may be misdiagnosed as dementia. Additionally, temporal lobe epilepsy in patients already diagnosed with dementia may go unrecognized. Diagnostic difficulties may also arise due to a lack of medical history or absence of eyewitness accounts. In older adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy, antiseizure medications are highly effective in controlling seizures. Accurate diagnosis is essential for effective seizure management and an improved quality of life.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), also known as Hakim's disease, is a major cause of reversible dementia in adults. iNPH primarily affects frontal lobe-related cognitive functions, including attention, executive function, and working memory, even in early stages. Although memory impairment is also present, recognition memory is often preserved, distinguishing iNPH from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), especially apathy, depression, and anxiety, are common in iNPH and are generally less active than those seen in AD. Neuropsychological assessments reveal significant impairments in frontal lobe tests such as the Frontal Assessment Battery and Trail Making Test-B. Shunt surgery leads to substantial improvement in attention and executive function, reflecting the reversible nature of iNPH. However, memory functions, particularly delayed recall, show limited recovery, indicating possible overlap with neurodegenerative mechanisms. Early surgical intervention is associated with better outcomes, while delayed treatment or advanced brain atrophy may reduce effectiveness. Comprehensive cognitive evaluation is essential for assessing treatment response, planning rehabilitation, and providing appropriate patient and family guidance.

Brexpirazole was approved for the treatment of nonpsychotic agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2023 after three phase 3 clinical trials found brexpiprazole 2 to 3 mg/day to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for agitation in AD dementia, albeit with small effect sizes. It appeared to especially benefit dementia patients with severe agitation/aggression, but it took between 6 and 12 weeks across the three studies for the medication to separate from placebo. However, much remains unknown about its place in the psychopharmacological armamentarium for the treatment of AD dementia-related agitation, including the optimal duration of a brexpiprazole trial, bridging options during the time it takes for brexpiprazole to become effective, and whether it should be continued in the presence of or upon emergence of psychosis during treatment. This Research in Action article uses a case vignette to synthesize the findings of the brexpiprazole trials and apply them to clinical practice, highlight the current uncertainties associated with its use, and compare it with other psychopharmacological options for the treatment of agitation in AD dementia.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC), Lewy body disease (LBD), and vascular neuropathologies occur together. Previous studies have been limited by a large majority of participants with severe dementia or advanced stages of pathologies, which limits the detectability of cognitive effects from vascular neuropathologies. METHODS: Using neuropathology data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, we examined the association of vascular neuropathologies with cognitive scores in participants without severe dementia (N = 1526) using multivariable linear regression. RESULTS: Controlling for age, sex, education, LBD, and ADNC, arteriolosclerosis was associated with lower memory (β = -0.16 ± 0.06, p < 0.001), executive function (β = -0.25 ± 0.05, p < 0.001), and language scores (β = -0.20 ± 0.05, p < 0.001). The effects of arteriolosclerosis remained when controlling for vascular risk factors. DISCUSSION: Vascular neuropathologies exhibit distinct relationships with cognition. Arteriolosclerosis is an independent contributor to cognition. Further research should be conducted on whether arteriolosclerosis can serve as a surrogate marker for cognitive decline in early disease stages. HIGHLIGHTS: In individuals who do not have severe dementia, vascular neuropathologies are common, and the combination of pathologies is heterogeneous in a convenience sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center that reported all the neuropathology data elements for this investigation. Arteriolosclerosis is associated with several cognitive domain scores, including memory, executive function, and language when controlling for the effects of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change and Lewy body disease. These results reinforce the importance of vascular pathology for cognition among people along the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.

BackgroundA novel neuroimaging signature of regional cortical thickness on brain MRI recently showed high potential for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) risk stratification in the community. How these findings translate to other populations, remains undetermined.ObjectiveWe aimed to replicate this novel ADRD neuroimaging marker in the population-based Rotterdam Study.MethodsWe included all participants from the population-based Rotterdam Study with brain-MRI between 2005-2016, and derived the signature using FreeSurfer. We computed hazard ratios and C-statistics for 10-year dementia risk, and betas for cross-sectional associations with cognition, comparing the novel signature to hippocampal volume, mean cortical thickness, and another cortical thickness signature (Dickerson's).ResultsOf 3249 participants (mean age 71.3 ± 8.0 years), 294 developed dementia (74.8% clinical AD) during a mean follow-up of 8.1 years. The novel ADRD signature had similar magnitude of associations as Dickerson's signature and cortical thickness for AD dementia (HR per 1-SD increase 0.87;0.78-0.96), but performed worse than all markers for all-cause dementia. Of the four neuroimaging markers, hippocampal volume showed the strongest associations with both risk of all-cause dementia and clinical AD dementia. The ADRD had the weakest association with general cognitive function (β per 1-SD increase 0.04;0.02-0.06), and executive function (β per 1-SD increase 0.02;0.00-0.04), followed by cortical thickness and Dickerson's, and hippocampal volume showed the strongest associations.ConclusionsIn this community-based study, the novel cortical thickness signature did not outperform hippocampal volume for dementia risk stratification. The importance of replication studies underlines the value of the current study. Replicating research findings is essential to establish robust biomarkers for dementia risk prediction.

BACKGROUND: No effective treatment is available to delay or reverse the onset and progression of Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Mild cognitive impairment, a clinical state between normal aging and AD, may offer the proper window for AD intervention and treatment. This systematic review aimed to summarize evidence from Mendelian randomization (MR) studies exploring factors attributable to AD and related cognitive status and to assess its credibility. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library to identify MR studies investigating the associations between any factor and AD and related cognitive status. The risk of bias in MR studies was evaluated using nine signaling questions tailored to identify potential biases based on the STROBE-MR guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 125 eligible publications were examined, including 106 AD-related MR studies reporting 674 records and 28 cognition-related MR studies reporting 141 records. We identified 185 unique causal risk factors for AD and 49 for cognitive status. More than half of the MR studies reporting AD or cognitive status outcomes exhibited poor methodological quality, with a high risk of bias observed in 59% of the AD-related studies and 64% of the cognitive-related studies. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review summarized modifiable factors and omics signatures, providing a database of MR studies on AD and related cognitive status. The evaluation of bias risk in MR studies serves to raise awareness and improve overall quality. A critical appraisal checklist for assessing the risk of bias may pave the way for the development of a standardized tool. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: The review protocol was registered with the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under the registration number CRD42023213990.

BACKGROUND: Soluble species of multimeric amyloid-beta including globular amyloid-beta oligomers (AβOs) and linear amyloid-beta protofibrils are toxic to neurons. Sabirnetug (ACU193) is a humanized monoclonal antibody, raised against globular species of soluble AβO, that has over 650-fold greater binding affinity for AβOs over monomers and appears to have relatively little binding to amyloid plaque. OBJECTIVES: To assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and exploratory measures including target engagement, biomarker effects, and clinical efficacy of sabirnetug in participants with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD; defined as mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia due to AD). DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose first-in-human phase 1 study. SETTING: Fifteen study centers in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-five participants with early symptomatic AD. INTERVENTION: Participants received one infusion of sabirnetug 2 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, or placebo (Part A) or three infusions of sabirnetug 10 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, or placebo (Part B). MEASUREMENTS: Safety, tolerability, serum pharmacokinetics, and central target engagement of single and multiple doses of sabirnetug, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of sabirnetug, and amyloid plaque load, as determined by positron emission tomography. RESULTS: Sabirnetug was generally well tolerated. A larger percentage of participants receiving sabirnetug (56.3%) versus placebo (42.9%) had at least one treatment emergent adverse event, with approximately 29% in each group considered related to study drug. Most events were mild-to-moderate in severity. Of 48 participants given sabirnetug, five developed amyloid related imaging abnormalities - edema/effusion, including one instance that was mildly symptomatic in a participant who had received one dose sabirnetug 60 mg/kg. Notably, none of the six apolipoprotein E Ɛ4 homozygotes who received sabirnetug developed amyloid related imaging abnormalities - edema/effusion or - hemorrhage/hemosiderin deposition. Infusion reactions, such as rash, pain, or erythema, were not frequent (6.3% for sabirnetug versus 0.0% for placebo). Sabirnetug exposure was dose proportional in both serum and CSF. Target engagement, defined as drug bound to AβOs in CSF, was shown to be dose and exposure dependent. Over three months, approximately 25% and 20% reduction in amyloid plaques, respectively, were observed in participants receiving three infusions of sabirnetug 60 mg/kg every four weeks and 25 mg/kg every two weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The Phase 1 INTERCEPT-AD study provided safety, tolerability, dosing, and target engagement data that supported the design of the ongoing ALTITUDE-AD study (NCT06335173).

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) reports heterogeneity of neuropsychological symptoms misleading the differential diagnosis with other forms of dementia, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). About 50% of DLB patients are misdiagnosed as AD cases. Likewise, the diagnosis of both diseases is mainly based on clinical characteristics. However, differentiating AD of those with DLB based on neuropsychological symptoms and anatomical and functional brain changes remains challenging. AIM: To establish the main neuropsychological, anatomical, and functional similarities and differences in patients with AD and DLB. METHODS: The present study followed the PRISMA guidelines and included studies from the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Sciences databases, published between January 2000 and July 2022. RESULTS: 41 articles were included in this systematic review for critical analysis. Our results suggest that the cognitive key domains to consider in the differential diagnosis are memory, executive function, attention, visuospatial/visuoconstructive skills, and verbal fluency (both semantic and phonological). The stage and severity of both diseases would be essential for differential diagnosis. On the other hand, the anatomical and functional changes suggest a similar atrophy pattern between AD and DLB in the frontal, parietal, temporal, hippocampal, and precuneus regions. CONCLUSION: The differential diagnosis between AD and DLB is challenging in clinical practice. Therefore, our results suggest exploring cognitive linguistic markers along with correlating these markers with anatomical and functional brain changes.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is the leading cause of cognitive decline in late life, yet treatment options remain limited. Lithium, widely used in bipolar disorder, has been suggested to exert neuroprotective effects through inhibition of GSK-3β and modulation of amyloid and tau pathology. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lithium in AD dementia. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was prospectively registered in PROSPERO and conducted following PRISMA guidelines. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library through April 2025 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing lithium with placebo or standard therapy in patients with AD dementia or amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Outcomes included cognition (MMSE, ADAS-Cog, memory tasks), function (CDR-SB, conversion to AD), neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI), CSF biomarkers, and safety (adverse events [AEs], serious AEs [SAEs]). Random-effects meta-analyses were complemented by Bayesian methods and trial sequential analyses. RESULTS: Six RCTs involving 394 participants (196 lithium, 198 placebo) met inclusion criteria. Lithium did not significantly improve global cognition (MMSE: MD -1.61, 95% CI -4.11 to 0.88; ADAS-Cog: MD -1.82, -3.05 to -0.60; both with high heterogeneity). Memory outcomes were mixed, with possible benefit for figure recall but not delayed verbal recall. No consistent benefits were observed for episodic memory, functional outcomes (CDR-SB), neuropsychiatric symptoms, or CSF biomarkers. Safety analyses showed no increased risk of SAEs; drug-related AEs were more frequent but heterogeneous across trials. CONCLUSIONS: Lithium demonstrated an acceptable safety profile within the dosing regimens studied. However, current evidence does not support consistent cognitive or functional benefits in AD dementia. Larger, well-designed RCTs are warranted to clarify its potential therapeutic role.

BACKGROUND: Synaptic protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may represent much-needed objective biomarkers of cognitive impairment, disease progression and drug efficacy in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment proteins receptors (SNARE) proteins, such as VAMP-2 and SNAP-25, are implicated in α-synuclein pathophysiology and CSF levels of these proteins are associated with pathophysiological biomarkers and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the study was to compare CSF levels of VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 in patients with DLB to cognitively unimpaired controls and AD patients and study their association with cognitive performance and AD and neurodegeneration biomarkers. METHODS: VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 were quantified in CSF from cognitively normal controls (n = 62), DLB (n = 44) and AD (n = 114) patients from the Sant Pau Initiative for Neurodegeneration (SPIN) cohort using homebrew Single Molecule Array assays (Simoa). The DLB group was stratified into two groups with ("DLB + AD", n = 28) or without AD co-pathology ("pure DLB", n = 16) using our validated cut-off for the CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau)/Aβ42 ratio. We used linear regression to test for group differences (adjusting for age) and association with AD biomarkers. We used standardized w-scores of the cognitive tests to analyze the association of the synaptic markers with cognitive performance. RESULTS: CSF VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 levels correlated across all groups (r = 0.71-0.9, p < 0.001). Both proteins were decreased in pure DLB (p < 0.001, p = 0.01) but increased in DLB + AD (p = 0.01, p = 0.02) compared to controls and showed good accuracy to discriminate pure DLB from DLB + AD (AUC = 0.84, 0.85). Both proteins were associated with CSF p-tau and total tau (t-tau) across all groups (r(2) = 0.49-0.88, p < 0.001), with the Aβ42/40 ratio in DLB + AD (r(2) = 0.29-0.36, p < 0.001) and in AD (r(2) = 0.12-0.23, p < 0.001) and with CSF neurofilament-light chain (NfL) in controls (r²=0.10-0.11, p < 0.001-0.01) and AD patients (r²=0.01-0.08, p = 0.01 - 0.001). SNAP-25 was associated with CSF NfL in the DLB + AD group (r²=0.15, p = 0.02). CSF VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 were associated with phonemic fluency in pure DLB (r(2) = 0.39 - 0.28, p = 0.01-0.03) and SNAP-25 with the Clock drawing test and the MMSE in DLB + AD (adj.r(2) = 0.15 - 0.14, p = 0.03-0.03) and DLB (adj.r(2) = 0.12 - 0.08, p = 0.02-0.04) groups. CONCLUSIONS: CSF VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 are promising surrogate markers of synapse degeneration in DLB. However, care should be taken when interpreting CSF levels of these synaptic markers in DLB in light of the confounding effect of AD pathophysiological markers.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study explores variations in brain activity between individuals with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) and healthy older adults during a resting state using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). METHODS: FNIRS measured brain activity in ten AD patients and six healthy individuals. A device with 16 channels was placed on each participant's forehead to measure oxygenation levels while they kept their eyes closed. The data were analyzed using a support vector machine (SVM) model. RESULTS: The results indicated differences in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) levels between the two groups. Specifically, HbO levels were generally higher in the dementia group in the left hemisphere, with a sharp increase after 26 s. Conversely, HbO levels were consistently lower in the right hemisphere of the dementia group. The SVM analysis demonstrated high accuracy in differentiating between the AD and healthy groups based on HbO levels. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that differences in brain activity during resting state can potentially distinguish people with DAT from healthy individuals. We found relatively reduced hemoglobin activity in the prefrontal areas of those with DAT. Furthermore, the concentration changes in the HbO in the left lateral prefrontal and right medial brain regions emerged as the most informative in distinguishing individuals with DAT from healthy individuals. The results of the current study show that this method could improve current DAT diagnostic practices due to its efficiency.

AIM: To evaluate the survival rates in well-characterized cohorts of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) subtypes - behavioral variant (bvFTD), progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), and semantic dementia (SD) - and both typical (amnestic) and atypical (aphasic: logopenic progressive aphasia [LPA]) presentations of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PATIENTS & METHODS: Three hundred and twenty-one participants (54 bvFTD, 26 PNFA, 22 SD, 20 LPA, 32 AD, 167 controls) were recruited. Patients underwent a comprehensive baseline assessment and annual reviews. Survival data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Median survival from symptom onset was longest in SD (11.9 years) and shortest in LPA (7 years). Median survival for the bvFTD, PNFA, and AD groups was 8.7, 8.6, and 10 years, respectively. SD survival was significantly longer than PNFA and AD. Female sex was associated with shorter survival in LPA. Shorter symptom duration at baseline assessment was related to shorter survival in bvFTD, SD, LPA, and AD. Lower overall cognition in bvFTD, LPA, and AD, and worse functional outcomes in SD and AD at baseline were associated with shorter survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate distinct survival patterns across FTD and AD subtypes. Demographic and presenting clinical features provide valuable prognostic insights for survival.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) can appear not only in Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) but in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study examined the association of BPSD with caregiver relationship, using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) score. The cognitive function of 419 new outpatients with ADD or MCI was evaluated using the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Caregiver relationship was significantly associated with patient age, sex, duration of education, cohabitation status, total NPI-Q score, and number of NPI-Q domains. Caregiver (oldest daughter), duration of school education, age, and total HDS-R and MMSE scores were significantly associated with NPI-Q total score and number of NPI-Q domains. The delusions, dysphoria/depression, irritability/lability, and aberrant motor behaviors domains were significantly associated with caregiver relationship. The dysphoria/depression and irritability/lability domain score were scored significantly higher by female caregivers. The delusion domain was significantly associated with cohabitation.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy and safety of brexpiprazole for the treatment of agitation symptoms in clinically relevant subgroups of patients with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Data were pooled for brexpiprazole (2 or 3 mg/day) and placebo from two international, randomized, double-blind trials in adults with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia with mild-to-severe cognitive dysfunction and with agitation (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01862640, NCT03548584). Change in agitation frequency over 12 weeks was measured using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Safety measures included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). In this post hoc analysis, thirteen clinically relevant subgroups were investigated based on care setting (institutionalized, non-institutionalized), severity of cognitive dysfunction (mild/moderate, severe), co-occurring behavioral symptoms (psychosis, depression, anxiety, irritability, sleep disturbance), and use of concomitant medications for dementia (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, memantine) and psychiatric conditions (antidepressant, benzodiazepine). RESULTS: In the randomized sample (N = 621), mean age was 74 years (range 55-90 years), 344 (55.4%) participants were female, and 277 (44.6%) were male. Over 12 weeks, brexpiprazole showed numerically greater reduction in agitation frequency than placebo in 12 of 13 subgroups. The only exception was "concomitant benzodiazepines", which was a small subgroup (n = 71), but showed efficacy for brexpiprazole in secondary analyses. The largest differences in favor of brexpiprazole versus placebo were for the concomitant antidepressant, co-occurring sleep disorder, and co-occurring psychosis subgroups. The overall incidence of TEAEs was generally consistent across subgroups. CONCLUSION: In these exploratory analyses, brexpiprazole reduced symptoms of agitation across a wide range of patients with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the association between Alzheimer pathology and dementia and the role of mAbs targeting amyloid in the treatment of people with dementia and mild cognitive impairment. RECENT FINDINGS: There is an association, but Alzheimer pathology explains less than 40% of the attributable risk of dementia when other pathologies such as vascular, Lewy Body and TDP-43 are accounted. Recent trials of passive immunization with MABs, including Aducanumab Lecanemab and Donanemab, have demonstrated some benefits but the effects are small in size and may be due to bias. The side effect of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) is common and potentially serious. The costs of assessments for treatment and actual treatment costs are large compared with potentially modest benefits. SUMMARY: It is still uncertain about the place of MABs in the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Further research is required regarding the long-term benefits and risks.

PURPOSE: Motor signs are frequently observed over the clinical course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We explored the potential clinical associations of motor manifestations in AD. METHODS: Our sample consisted of older adults (≥ 60 years) with AD from NACC. Individuals with Parkinson's disease or other Parkinsonian syndrome or under anti-parkinsonian agents were excluded. UPDRS III was used to assess motor signs in nine domains: hypophonia; masked facies; resting tremor; action/postural tremor; rigidity; bradykinesia; impaired chair rise; impaired posture/gait; postural instability. A global motor variable assessed the presence of at least one motor sign. Binary logistic models were estimated for the global (primary) and individual motor domain variables (secondary outcomes). RESULTS: A total of 4771 older, predominantly female, well-educated participants were analysed: 3556 without (75.4 ± 7.6 years, 45.6% males) and 1215 with motor manifestations (79.4 ± 7.8 years, 44.4% males). The most influential risk factor for motor manifestations in AD was the Clinical Dementia Rating stage: stage one increased the odds of motor signs by ~ 44%, stage two by ~ 168% and stage three by ~ 437%. Each additional point on the Geriatric Depression Scale elevated the odds of motor manifestations by ~ 5%, whereas each additional point on the Mini-Mental State Examination decreased these odds by ~ 2.5%. Cerebrovascular disease (by ~ 44%), diabetes mellitus (by ~ 25%), traumatic brain injury (by ~ 30%), alcohol abuse (by ~ 33%), anxiolytics (by ~ 36%), antidepressants (by ~ 31%), antipsychotics (by ~ 48%) and β-blockers (by ~ 33%) elevated the odds of motor manifestations. Angiotensin II receptor blockers decreased the odds of motor manifestations (by ~ 33%). CONCLUSION: Disease progression constitutes the most crucial clinical risk factor for motor manifestations in AD.

Neuroinflammation represents a key pathophysiological process contributing to cognitive decline during aging and may play a significant role in the development of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD). Many magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have investigated the extent and impact of neuroinflammation in older adults and in individuals at various stages of ADRD. These imaging techniques enable the assessment of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, structural damage in white and gray matter, and functional brain impairment. In this review, we summarize the advantages and limitations of various MRI protocols used to study neuroinflammation. With a focus on neuroinflammation, studies that characterized structural and functional brain changes but did not relate the findings to neuroinflammation were outside the scope of this review. However, we provided a brief survey on studies combining multiple imaging modalities for readers to have a broader view on neuroinflammation, aging, and ADRD. We first begin by introducing MRI techniques used to examine BBB dysfunction, neuroinflammation, gray and white matter deficits, and functional brain changes. Next, we reviewed studies investigating neuroinflammation in aging, followed by examination of imaging studies of ADRD in this context. Collectively, these findings indicate that both aging and AD are associated with progressive BBB dysfunction contributing to cognitive decline. Additionally, neural markers derived of diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic transfer imaging, MR spectroscopy, structural imaging, and functional connectivity provide valuable insights into neuroinflammatory processes. This body of research highlights MRI's potential as a non-invasive tool for monitoring neuroinflammation and tracking disease onset and progression.

BACKGROUND: Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) may influence the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, prior studies have focused on specific pairs of NDDs and variants of AD/FTD. Adopting a dimensional approach to NDDs and considering the heterogeneity of AD/FTD, we investigated the association between a neurodevelopmental vulnerability (DV) and the clinical presentation and age at onset of AD/FTD. METHODS: We prospectively and consecutively recruited 84 AD/FTD participants and 41 matched controls. AD/FTD participants were classified into typical (amnestic AD, behavioral FTD) and atypical (primary progressive aphasia, frontal and posterior variants of AD, right temporal variant of FTD, amnestic FTD) presentations. Participants underwent a neuropsychological assessment and answered a novel questionnaire on NDDs symptoms. Using k-means clustering based on the questionnaire, participants were assigned to a DV+ (with neurodevelopmental vulnerability) or a DV- (without) cluster. This data-driven approach enabled an unbiased classification of individuals with a DV, beyond traditional diagnostic labels. RESULTS: DV frequencies did not differ between the AD/FTD (18%) and control (15%) χ(2) = 0.205; p = 0.651); and between typical (21%) and atypical (11%) subgroups (Fisher's test, p = 0.184). However, in DV+ patients, symptom onset occurred 8.0 years earlier than in DV- patients (95% CI [-14, -3.0]; p = 0.005), with a median onset age of 58 years (IQR: 15). CONCLUSIONS: A DV could favor early-onset AD/FTD, but may not affect susceptibility to typical and atypical variants of AD/FTD. The underlying neurophysiological processes involved require future investigation, with implications for precision medicine and individualized treatment strategies.

BackgroundSerum trace elements, anthropometric data, and oxidative stress markers are often altered in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other types of dementia (OTD). However, these parameters are rarely examined together before disease onset in a single study population.ObjectiveThis nested case-control study aims to investigate anthropometric data, serum trace elements, exchangeable copper (CuEXC), and oxidative stress markers to identify early associations with the risk of AD or OTD.MethodsFrom the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam cohort (DRKS-ID: DRKS00020593), the High Fat Diet, Microbiota, and Neuroinflammation in the Progression of Alzheimer study was generated. One hundred twenty-eight individuals who developed AD or OTD were identified, approximately 15.7 years after baseline data collection, and matched for age, sex, fasting status, and season of blood sampling with 512 controls. Serum levels of manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se), iodine (I), CuEXC, and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) were analyzed.ResultsCases and non-cases did not differ in anthropometric data or oxidative stress markers. Female cases exhibited a trend of elevated serum Cu and CuEXC levels compared to female non-cases. A higher Se/Cu ratio suggested an inverse association (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.56-0.92), while an increased Cu/Zn ratio was positively associated (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1-4.1) with AD or OTD incidence.ConclusionsRatios of serum trace elements, rather than individual levels, show early associations with the risk of AD or OTD while anthropometric and oxidative stress markers did not.

DNA methylation is a critical epigenetic mechanism involved in numerous physiological processes. Alterations in DNA methylation patterns are associated with various brain disorders, including dementias such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Investigating these alterations is essential for understanding the pathogenesis and progression of these disorders. Among the various methods for detecting DNA methylation, DNA sequencing is one of the most widely employed. Specifically, two main sequencing approaches are commonly used for DNA methylation analysis: bisulfite sequencing and single-molecule long-read sequencing. In this review, we compared the performances of CpG methylation detection obtained using two popular sequencing platforms, Illumina for bisulfite sequencing and Oxford Nanopore (ON) for long-read sequencing. Our comparison considers several factors, including accuracy, efficiency, genomic regions, costs, wet-lab protocols, and bioinformatics pipelines. We provide insights into the strengths and limitations of both methods with a particular focus on their application in research on AD and FTD.

INTRODUCTION: African American (AA) individuals are underrepresented in biomarker studies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Biomarkers that reflect the heterogeneity of AD and achieve the greatest accuracy across populations are sorely needed. METHODS: Untargeted proteome measurements were obtained using the SomaScan 7k platform to identify novel plasma biomarkers for AD in AA participants with clinical diagnoses of AD dementia (n = 181) and cognitively unimpaired (CU, n = 142). Machine learning was used to identify a set of plasma proteins that yielded the best classification accuracy. RESULTS: A set of 36 proteins achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 to classify AD dementia versus CU, a 16% improvement over age, sex, and apolipoprotein E (APOE). This finding was replicated in multiple plasma and brain datasets (AUCs 0.73-0.97). Our findings underscore the importance of matrisome and cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD pathophysiology. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the potential of biomarker discovery through untargeted plasma proteomics and machine learning. HIGHLIGHTS: Conducted large-scale plasma proteomics in Alzheimer's disease (AD) versus cognitively unimpaired controls. Machine learning biomarker discovery was replicated in an independent cohort. Novel set of proteins distinguishes AD versus controls with high accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.94). Achieved reproducibility across multiple replication cohorts (AUC = 0.73-0.97). Network analyses implicates matrisome biology and cerebrovascular dysfunction.

Hemispheric asymmetries are a core feature of brain organization and may influence neurodegenerative processes. Handedness has been proposed as a behavioral marker of lateralization, but its relevance in dementia remains unclear. To determine whether individuals with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, differ from healthy controls in the prevalence of left-, mixed-, and non-right-handedness (left- and mixed-handedness), frequentist and Bayesian meta-analytic approaches were used. First, a systematic literature search following PRISMA guidelines was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar through March 2025 using the terms: "((dementia) OR (Alzheimer's disease)) AND (handedness)." Inclusion criteria required studies to (1) report handedness for both dementia and control groups, (2) not match participants for handedness, and (3) provide sufficient statistical data. Eighteen studies (N = 13,282 dementia patients, N = 18,540 controls) met the criteria. Frequentist meta-analyses showed that individuals with dementia were significantly less likely to be non-right-handed (OR = 0.90, 95 % CI: 0.83-0.97, p = 0.01) and mixed-handed (OR = 0.71, 95 % CI: 0.59-0.85, p = 0.01) compared to controls. However, sensitivity analyses excluding the largest study rendered these associations non-significant, indicating limited robustness. Bayesian meta-analyses supported the null hypothesis with moderate-to-strong evidence across all handedness categories (BF₁₀ = 0.06-1.06). Exploratory Bayesian meta-regressions tested dementia subtype as a moderator and revealed no significant effects. In conclusion, while handedness differences in dementia appear small and sensitive to study design, emerging patterns, particularly in mixed-handedness, may reflect subtle disruptions in hemispheric specialization. Further research may clarify whether such traits provide early behavioral signals of neurodegenerative changes.

INTRODUCTION: List-learning tasks are important for characterizing memory in ADRD research, but the Uniform Data Set neuropsychological battery (UDS-NB) lacks a list-learning paradigm; thus, sites administer a range of tests. We developed a harmonized memory composite that incorporates UDS memory tests and multiple list-learning tasks. METHODS: Item-banking confirmatory factor analysis was applied to develop a memory composite in a diagnostically heterogenous sample (n=5943) who completed the UDS-NB and one of five list-learning tasks. Construct validity was evaluated through associations with demographics, disease severity, cognitive tasks, brain volume, and plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau181 and p-tau217). Test-retest reliability was assessed. Analyses were replicated in a racially/ethnically diverse cohort (n=1058). RESULTS: Fit indices, loadings, distributions, and test-retest reliability were adequate. Expected associations with demographics and clinical measures within development and validation cohorts supported validity. DISCUSSION: This composite enables researchers to incorporate multiple list-learning tasks with other UDS measures to create a single metric.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide, affecting over 55 million individuals and projected to rise drastically in the coming decades. Characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory impairment, AD involves complex pathological mechanisms including amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque accumulation, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of hyperphosphorylated tau, and chronic neuroinflammation. OBJECTIVE: This comprehensive review aims to provide a foundational understanding of the molecular, genetic, and immunological underpinnings of AD, with a focus on pathogenic proteins, glial cell responses, and current monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapeutic strategies. METHODS: Literature on key pathological players such as Aβ, tau, microglia, and astrocytes was mentioned to explain their roles in neurodegeneration. The impact of key genetic mutations (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, APOE, BACE1, MAPT) was outlined. Additionally, recent clinical trial data of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (aducanumab, lecanemab, donanemab) were reviewed, with comparative analysis of efficacy, safety, and trial outcomes. RESULTS: Neuroinflammation, mediated by activated microglia and astrocytes, exacerbates Aβ and tau pathology, contributing to synaptic loss and neuronal death. Genetic mutations alter APP processing and promote plaque formation. Monoclonal antibodies show promise in reducing Aβ burden and slowing cognitive decline: donanemab achieved 60% slower decline in mild cognitive impairment, while lecanemab showed 27% cognitive benefit in early AD. Aducanumab, despite initial promise, was discontinued in 2024 due to limited efficacy and safety concerns. Adverse events like amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), particularly in APOE-4 carriers, remain significant. CONCLUSION: AD pathology is multifactorial, involving an interplay between protein aggregation, immune dysregulation, and genetic risk. While mAb therapies mark progress in disease modification, their success depends on patient stratification, early intervention, and safety profiling. Future directions must emphasize combinatorial and personalized approaches incorporating early biomarkers, neuroimaging, and emerging technologies to effectively combat the rising global burden of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative illness affecting nearly 7 million people in the United States. Until 2023, no disease-targeting pharmacotherapeutics were widely available outside of research studies. With relatively recent regulatory approval and increasing availability of antiamyloid therapies (AATs) in the United States, management of AD is rapidly shifting from symptomatic and supportive care alone to treatments aimed at disease modification. Appropriate selection of patients for AATs can be challenging and varies among health care settings and systems despite published appropriate-use recommendations. The first of this two-part Treatment in Behavioral Neurology & Neuropsychiatry series from the American Neuropsychiatric Association Dementia Special Interest Group addresses the challenges with patient selection. In this second part, the authors offer dementia-focused health care vignettes to illustrate challenges with AAT delivery encountered in different settings and discuss emerging logistical issues associated with delivery of dementia-focused care based on AAT protocols.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia has near full penetrance in adults with Down syndrome (DS) and is strongly linked to late-onset myoclonic epilepsy in Down syndrome (LOMEDS). However, promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity, such as high-frequency oscillations (HFOs >250 Hz), have not been studied. This study is the first to use wideband polysomnography in DS to investigate if HFOs occurred and preceded AD dementia and LOMEDS. METHODS: Wideband (0.1 to 500 Hz, 2048 Hz) polysomnography was performed using the international 10-20 system. HFOs were automatically detected during slow-wave sleep, followed by manual review. RESULTS: Fourteen individuals with DS and five age-matched euploid controls were studied, with all DS cases showing HFOs. HFOs emerged before AD dementia and LOMEDS and showed hemispheric lateralization in asymptomatic but not symptomatic AD dementia cases. A trend toward increasing HFO rates with age in DS warrants further confirmation. DISCUSSION: HFOs are promising biomarkers that may predict symptomatic AD dementia in adults with DS. HIGHLIGHTS: Wideband polysomnography reveals a new electrical abnormality in DS. HFOs precede AD dementia in DS. The occurrence of HFOs in DS is independent of an epilepsy diagnosis. HFOs showed hemispheric lateralization in asymptomatic DS cases. A trend of increased HFO rate with advancing age warrants further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are widely used in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to systematically review the literature about movement disorders (MDs) associated with AChEIs for AD, which include donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, tacrine, and ipidacrine. METHODOLOGY: Two reviewers conducted a comprehensive review of relevant studies across six databases, without language restrictions, covering publications from 1992 to 2024. RESULTS: Overall, 74 studies containing 92 cases were found of MDs related to ACHEIs. The MDs found were Pisa syndrome in 33 patients, parkinsonism in 31, myoclonus in 11, dystonia in 10, dyskinesia in 6, and extrapyramidal symptoms in 1. Regarding the medications, the abnormal movements were associated with donepezil in 62 cases, rivastigmine in 15, galantamine in 10, and tacrine in 5. No case of ipidacrine-induced MD was found. Overall, the most commonly affected sex was the female, accounting for 61.9% of the cases. The mean and median age was 74.1 (standard deviation: 8.9) and 75 years (range: 49-93 years). The MD occurred within 6 months of the starting of AChEI in approximately 70% of the patients. Furthermore, the full recovery of the MD after the main management was noticed within 6 months in about 80% of the patients. About 86.3% of the individuals fully recovered after treatment, which included AChEI discontinuation, dose adjustment, and prescription of additional therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of tacrine-induced tremor indicated a potential predisposition to movement disorders associated with AChEI therapy. Based on the drug class side effect profile, it is possible that future studies may observe abnormal movements with other AChEIs.

INTRODUCTION: Perivascular space (PVS) alterations are traditionally linked to cardiovascular risk factors and aging, but may also play a direct role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To reduce confounding from age-related comorbidities, we examined PVSs in autosomal dominant AD (ADAD). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study of 96 non-demented individuals (62 mutation carriers), we quantified PVS count fraction and mean diameter in white matter and basal ganglia using automated magnetic resonance imaging analysis. Linear mixed models assessed group differences along the disease course, adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Compared to non-carriers, mutation carriers showed lower PVS count fraction in white matter and basal ganglia, and larger PVS diameter in basal ganglia and the temporal lobe. Changes were evident up to 18 years before expected dementia onset and followed trajectories similar to amyloid beta 42 and tau biomarkers. DISCUSSION: ADAD is associated with early PVS alterations, suggesting perivascular changes may be integral to primary AD pathology. HIGHLIGHTS: Autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) mutation carriers have reduced magnetic resonance imaging-visible perivascular space (PVS) count fraction in the white matter and basal ganglia. ADAD mutation carriers show enlarged PVS in the basal ganglia and temporal white matter. PVS alterations start 18 years before the estimated time of dementia diagnosis. The spatial localization of PVS changes overlaps with regions of amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation. The temporal evolution of PVS alterations aligns with Aβ and tau changes in the cerebrospinal fluid.

Background/Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by an irreversible decline in cognitive function. The pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders has been linked to changes in the gut microbiota, transmitted through the gut-brain axis. Methods: We set out to establish by case-control study methodology whether there were any differences in the composition and/or function of the gut microbiota between older resident adults in care homes with or without an AD diagnosis via analysis of the microbial composition from fecal samples. Results: The microbial composition, determined by 16S rRNA gene profiling, indicated that AD sufferers had significantly increased proportions of Escherichia/Shigella and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, and significantly decreased proportions of Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Blautia, and Roseburia species. The increase in potentially pro-inflammatory bacteria was consistent with slightly higher concentrations of calprotectin, a biomarker of gut inflammation. Fecal concentrations of most microbial metabolites measured were similar across groups, although participants with AD had significantly increased proportions of the branched-chain fatty acid, iso-butyrate, and lower overall concentrations of total short chain fatty acids. Conclusions: Participants with Alzheimer's disease have several key differences within their gut microbiota profile, in contrast to care home residents without Alzheimer's disease. The altered microbiome included both compositional and functional changes linked to poorer health and gut inflammation.

The biology of individual lipid species and their relevance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains incompletely understood. To explore the lipidomic biomarkers associated with cognition function and neuropathological changes in AD, we utilize non-targeted mass spectrometry on 316 post-mortem brains from participants in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) or Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) cohorts classified as control, asymptomatic AD (AAD), or symptomatic AD (SAD), and integrate the lipidomics data with untargeted proteomics from the same individuals. We find that lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) species are significantly lower in SAD than controls or AAD. Lipid-protein network analyses reveal that LPE/LPC modules are significantly associated with protein modules involved in MAPK/metabolism, post-synaptic density, and cell-ECM interaction pathways, and correlate with better antemortem cognition and reduced AD neuropathology. Particularly, LPE 22:6 [sn-1] is significantly decreased SAD and exerts a pronounced influence on protein changes relevant to neurotransmitter-driven post synaptic changes and plasticity compared to other lysophospholipids species. These findings suggest LPE 22:6 as a potential lipid signature and therapeutic target for AD.

OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are common neurodegenerative diseases with distinct but overlapping pathogenic mechanisms. The clinical similarities between these diseases often result in high misdiagnosis rates, leading to serious consequences. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are easy to collect and can accurately reflect the immune characteristics of both DLB and AD. METHODS: We utilized time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) with single-cell resolution to quantitatively analyze peripheral PBMCs, identifying 1228 immune characteristics. Based on the top-selected immune features, we constructed immunological elastic net (iEN) models. RESULTS: These models demonstrated high diagnostic efficacy in distinguishing diseased samples from healthy donors as well as distinguishing AD and DLB cases. The selected features reveal that the primary peripheral immune characteristic of AD is a decrease in total T cells, while DLB is characterized by low expression of I-kappa-B-alpha (IKBα) in the classical monocyte subset. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that peripheral immune characteristics could serve as potential biomarkers, facilitating the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Almost all patients with neurodegenerative dementias experience neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) but the timing and clinical course is highly variable. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study in Western Norway, patients with a new diagnosis of mild dementia were assessed annually in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) for up to 9 years until death. Patients with post-mortem neuropathological diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (pAD) (n = 37), Lewy body disease (pLBD) (n = 14) or meeting criteria for both AD and LBD (mixed AD+LBD) (n = 11) were included in this study. Neuropathological assessment was performed according to standardised protocols and blind to clinical information. In mixed effects logistic regression, longitudinal change in NPS was explored across neuropathological diagnoses and substrates. Additionally, the odds of NPS early and late in disease was evaluated in logistic regression. RESULTS: Early onset hallucinations were significantly more common in pLBD than pAD (OR 0.069 [95% CI 0.012-0.397], p = 0.003) or mixed AD+LBD (OR 0.09 [95% CI 0.010-0.771], p = 0.028) and there was a greater increase in the odds of hallucinations over time in pAD and AD+LBD than pLBD such that there was was no difference in the prevalence of late-onset hallucinations between pLBD, pAD or AD+LBD. Hallucinations early in disease were associated with higher LBD α-synuclein stages and neocortical LBD, in addition and sparser amyloid distribution. Higher density of amyloid plaques, tau tangles, cerebrovascular disease and increasing additional co-pathologies were associated with increasing odds of hallucinations over time. CONCLUSIONS: LBD, without significant comorbid AD pathology, is associated with hallucinations early in the course of disease while multiple other pathologies may be implicated in aetiology of late-onset hallucinations. Hallucinations increase in AD+LBD as disease progresses, a trajectory more closely aligned with AD than LBD.

Despite the presence of significant Alzheimer's disease pathology, characterized by amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and phosphorylated tau (pTau) tangles, some cognitively unimpaired elderly individuals do not inevitably develop dementia. Cortical astroglial inflammation, a ubiquitous feature of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, shows a strong correlation with cognitive impairment severity, highlighting the influence of factors beyond classical pathology. However, non-invasively imaging neuroinflammation, particularly astrogliosis, using MRI remains a significant challenge. Here we sought to address this challenge and to leverage multidimensional (MD) MRI, a powerful approach that combines relaxation with diffusion MR contrasts, to map cortical astrogliosis in the human brain by accessing sub-voxel information. Our goal was to investigate whether MD-MRI can map astroglial pathology in the cerebral cortex, and if so, whether it can distinguish cognitively normal state from dementia in the presence of hallmark Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes. We adopted a multimodal approach by integrating histological and MRI analyses using human postmortem brain samples from two independent discovery and replication cohorts. Ex vivo cerebral cortical tissue specimens were derived from two groups-non-demented individuals with varying levels of postmortem Alzheimer's disease pathology and individuals with both Alzheimer's disease pathology and dementia-and scanned using 7 T MRI. We acquired and processed MD-MRI, diffusion tensor, and quantitative T(1) and T(2) MRI data, followed by histopathology on the same tissue. By co-registering MRI and microscopy data, we performed quantitative multimodal analyses, leveraging targeted immunostaining to assess MD-MRI sensitivity and specificity towards Aβ, pTau, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for astrogliosis. Our discovery analysis reveals a distinct MD-MRI signature of cortical astrogliosis, enabling the creation of predictive maps for cognitive state amid Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes. Multiple linear regression analysis linked histological values to MRI changes, revealing that the MD-MRI cortical astrogliosis biomarker was significantly associated with GFAP burden (standardized β = 0.658/0.709, p (FDR) < 0.0001), but not with Aβ (standardized β = 0.009/0.120, p (FDR) = 0.913/0.274) or pTau (standardized β = -0.196/0.158, p (FDR) = 0.051/0.251), for the discovery/replication groups, respectively. Conversely, none of the conventional MRI parameters showed significant associations with GFAP burden in the cortex. Finally, we showed that the MD-MRI-derived astrogliosis biomarker is the only MRI measure capable of predicting cognitive state. While the extent to which pathological glial activation contributes to neuronal damage and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease is uncertain, developing a non-invasive imaging method to see its effects holds promise from a mechanistic perspective and as a potential predictor of cognitive outcomes.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have a profound impact on patients' quality of life (QoL), with progressive declines occurring as the disease advances. This systematic review aims to summarize the published evidence on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in individuals with MCI due to AD and mild AD dementia. Comprehensive searches were conducted across five major databases to identify studies reporting on utility values, disutilities, and QoL measures in these patient populations. A total of 23 studies were included that utilized various QoL assessment tools, including EQ-5D (n = 14), SF-36/SF-12 (n = 4), and QOL-AD (n = 11). Reported EQ-5D scores ranged from 0.81 to 0.92 for patients with MCI and from 0.67 to 0.85 for those with mild AD, indicating a noticeable decline in QoL as the disease progresses. QOL-AD scores ranged from 33.8 to 42.5 for MCI and from 32.4 to 38.1 for mild AD, equally reflecting the greater impairment in QoL with disease advancement. Interventions were generally associated with smaller declines in PROs compared to placebo, suggesting a positive impact of treatment in mitigating QoL deterioration. The findings underscore the significant QoL differences between MCI and mild AD, emphasizing the potential benefit of early intervention to preserve QoL and delay disease progression. This review highlights the importance of continued research to better understand QoL in patients with MCI and mild AD dementia, particularly in terms of capturing comprehensive patient-reported outcomes and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions over time. These findings can contribute to a more informed approach in clinical practice and support decision-making in the management of early-stage AD.

INTRODUCTION: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a common co-pathology in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A comprehensive characterization of CSVD load in DLB and AD patients referred to a memory center is lacking. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we collected data from patients with a clinical DLB diagnosis or clinico-biological AD diagnosis, evaluated at our memory center. They were assessed for CSVD MRI features, including enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and hypertensive arteriopathy (HTNA). Differences in CSVD features between AD and DLB and across clinical stages were investigated. Regression models were used to evaluate the association between (i) cerebrovascular risk factors (CVRF) and HTNA, and (ii) CSVD features and cognition as expressed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). RESULTS: We included 71 DLB (76.8 ± 7.4 years old, 25 females) and 71 age- and sex-matched AD patients (and 75.2 ± 5.3 years old, 27 females). Probable CAA, according to current Boston 2.0 criteria, was observed in 22.5% of DLB and 35.2% of AD patients, while any (probable + possible) CAA rate was higher in the two groups (71.8% and 91.5%, respectively). A moderate/severe HTNA was present in 45% of DLB and 28.2% of AD patients. When comparing the two groups, DLB presented with higher HTNA score (p =.012), while AD patients had higher prevalence of any CAA (p =.002). Patients with DLB had a greater PVS burden in the basal ganglia (p =.011) and centrum semiovale (p =.004) and higher number of deep microbleeds (p =.004). Certain HTNA-related features were more pronounced at dementia stage, with respect to mild cognitive impairment. No association was observed between CVRF and HTNA. Regarding the association between CSVD and cognition, only deep microbleeds count was related to MoCA in DLB patients. DISCUSSION: DLB or AD patients present with high CSVD burden and differ in terms of features and subtype. Patients with DLB present with increased HTNA, PVS load and deep microbleeds, while patients with AD present with a higher any CAA prevalence. CSVD might impact global cognition.

This study explored how adherence to the DASH diet relates to electrophysiological measures in individuals at varying Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk due to family history (FH). There were 179 dementia-free subjects. DASH index was calculated, and participants were classified into different DASH adherence groups. Tertiles of relative alpha power in default mode network (DMN) regions were calculated. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the association. Lower DASH adherence was associated with decreased odds of higher relative alpha power in the DMN, observed across the entire sample and specifically among those without a FH of AD. Logistic regression models indicated that participants with poorer DASH adherence had a reduced likelihood of elevated DMN alpha power, potentially influenced by vascular and amyloid-beta mechanisms. These findings underscore the dietary pattern's potential role in neural activity modulation, particularly in individuals not genetically predisposed to AD.

BackgroundAn Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis made in the earliest symptomatic stages substantially benefits patients and their care partners. However, little is known regarding the clinical, healthcare system-level, and patient-specific barriers that hinder timely diagnosis and treatment.ObjectiveTo explore real-world practices surrounding the diagnostic journey and management of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/AD dementia patients.MethodsData were drawn from Adelphi Real World Dementia Disease Specific Programme™, a cross-sectional survey of physicians treating MCI/AD dementia patients in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan between 2022 and 2024.ResultsOverall, 779 physicians reported data on 5551 patients. Physicians indicated current disease severity for 5421 patients; 37.2% had MCI (87.3% with suspected prodromal AD and 12.7% undetermined etiology), 17.2% AD with mild dementia, 31.1% AD with moderate dementia, and 14.5% AD with severe dementia. When not immediately diagnosed, the median time from first consultation to initial diagnosis was 8.9 and 12.6 weeks when patients first consulted and were diagnosed by either a primary care practitioner (PCP) or a specialist, respectively, compared with 21.6 weeks when a PCP referred to a specialist for diagnosis. Diagnostic delays were predominantly due to specialist wait times. Few patients had diagnostic AD biomarker tests (cerebrospinal fluid testing 9.5%, amyloid positron emission tomography 3.7%, AD-blood tests 5.3%).ConclusionsTimely MCI and AD diagnosis is impeded by referral delays and limited use of biomarker testing. Addressing these critical care gaps requires enhanced physician training, reduced wait times and increased biomarker utilization for early management.

Recent studies have identified the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene as a potential candidate influencing Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. It is crucial to investigate the impact of ACE on AD pathology and its underlying mechanisms. A total of 450 non-demented participants from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with data on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ACE, AD core biomarkers and inflammation-related biomarkers were included. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the associations among CSF ACE, AD core biomarkers and inflammation-related biomarkers. And we used the mediation models to investigate the potential mechanisms through which ACE influenced AD pathology. The results of multiple linear regression were shown that CSF ACE was significantly correlated with CSF Aβ(42), P-tau, T-tau (all P < 0.001), and inflammation-related biomarkers (soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 [sTREM2], progranulin [PGRN], glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], transforming growth factor [TGF]-β1, TGF-β2, TGF-β3, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-R1, TNF-R2, TNF-α, interleukin [IL]-21, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p40, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1], and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1]) (all P < 0.05). In addition, the mediation analysis results showed that the association of CSF ACE and inflammation-related biomarkers (sTREM2, PGRN, TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TNFR1, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, and VCAM-1) mediated the correlation of CSF Aβ(42) with P-tau. Our findings show that CSF ACE and neuroinflammation are correlated and that their correlation mediates the link between Aβ pathology and P-tau. This suggests ACE may play a significant role in the progression from Aβ pathology to tau pathology.

BACKGROUND: The long-term safety and efficacy of brexpiprazole in Asian patients with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease are unknown. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety of 14-week treatment with brexpiprazole 1 or 2 mg/day in Japanese patients who completed the 10-week double-blind treatment period in a parent phase 2/3 study, and to explore the efficacy of brexpiprazole. METHODS: This was a phase 3 multicenter, open-label study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03724942, registered on 28 October 2018). Patients who had completed 10-week treatment of placebo, 1 or 2 mg/day of brexpiprazole in a parent study were rolled over into this extended study. The primary endpoint was the frequency of adverse events. RESULTS: Of 183 patients with informed consent, 164 were treated with brexpiprazole 1 or 2 mg/day for 14 weeks (prior brexpiprazole subgroup: 102 patients, prior placebo subgroup: 62 patients), and the overall study completion rate was 71.3%. The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 90.2% (in each subgroup, 90.2% and 90.3%, respectively). Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, and no new safety signals were observed. Regarding the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory total score at Week 14 (last observation carried forward), the mean change from baseline (standard deviation) was -4.0 (9.8). CONCLUSIONS: The extended 14-week treatment with brexpiprazole 1 or 2 mg/day after 10-week treatment was generally well tolerated in Japanese patients with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, and the efficacy was maintained.

The relationship between dietary biotin intake and cognitive function remains unclear. This study explores the association between biotin and dementia, and the mediating role of inflammation indicators. Dietary biotin intake was assessed via the 24-h recall questionnaire. Dementia outcomes were identified through "algorithmically defined outcomes," identified through an algorithm integrating self-reports, hospital admissions, and death certificate records. Participants aged 40-69 with complete biotin and baseline data were included. During a 11.25-year median follow-up, 1256 incident dementia cases occurred among 122 959 participants. Cox proportional hazards models showed that compared to the lowest biotin intake (Q1), biotin reduced the risk of all-cause dementia (HR: 0.75[0.64,0.88] p < 0.001 for Q2; HR: 0.68[0.58,0.81] p < 0.001 for Q3; HR: 0.67[0.56,0.81] p < 0.001 for Q4) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (HR: 0.74[0.58,0.96] p = 0.026 for Q2; HR: 0.65[0.49,0.85] p = 0.002 for Q3). Restricted cubic splines (RCSs) revealed an "L-shaped" nonlinear relationship between biotin and all-cause dementia (p nonlinear < 0.001) and Alzheimer's dementia (p nonlinear = 0.004) and exhibited the saturation effect. Multicategorical mediation analysis suggested that systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), a composite inflammatory marker calculated from platelet, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts, mediated the association partially. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses confirmed stable results. Higher dietary biotin intake may reduce the risk of dementia.

BackgroundNeuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are frequent in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, but a higher NPS burden is found in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Lewy body (LB) pathology frequently co-occurs with AD pathology and may not meet neuropathological criteria for DLB (ADLB). NPS trajectories over disease course in these subgroups is not well understood.ObjectiveWe investigated changes in NPS severity over time, at two time points, comparing clinicopathologically defined cohorts of AD (without LB), ADLB, DLB, and controls.MethodsCases with two available Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPIQ), at the time of enrollment and within 2.5 years of death, were selected from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders. Differences and rate of change in NPIQ scores were compared between AD (n = 75), ADLB (n = 48) DLB (n = 65), and controls (n = 32) with covariates for age, sex, and cognition.ResultsFirst NPIQ scores were highest in ADLB when compared to AD (p = 0.04) and controls (p = 0.01) but not different from DLB. A significant increase in NPS severity was observed in DLB and AD (p < 0.001) over a mean follow up time of 4.9 ± 3.0 years, and the rate of change was significantly greater in DLB when compared to other groups. Final NPIQ scores were highest in DLB when compared to AD (p = 0.03) but not ADLB, and in DLB, ADLB, and AD than controls (all p < 0.001).ConclusionsEarly NPS burden as well as NPS severity progression rate, independently of cognitive status, might be useful clinical metrics and may help predict underlying pathological diagnoses.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are the most burdensome neurodegenerative disorders in older populations as they pose significant challenges because of subtle cognitive decline in the initial stages. This study proposes a novel approach to distinguishing AD, FTD, and cognitively normal (CN) subjects using electroencephalography (EEG) time-domain analysis through Hjorth parameters (Activity, Mobility, and Complexity). By exploring various window lengths and moving lengths to determine the optimal segment where dementia features are most pronounced, the proposed method achieved high classification accuracy across multiple diagnostic categories. Using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), the approach attained 92.5% accuracy for AD&FTD/CN classification. In individual group classifications, the method attained 88.6% accuracy for AD/CN using LDA and 96.0% accuracy for FTD/CN using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). AD classification demonstrated 92.6% sensitivity and 83.5% specificity, while FTD classification achieved 85.9% sensitivity and 95.5% specificity. Furthermore, a significant correlation (r =0.70, ${p} =0.01$ ) was found between Hjorth parameters and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, validating the method's potential for cognitive decline assessment. The optimal time segmentation approach and high classification accuracy represent substantial improvements over existing methods, offering a reliable and interpretable tool for clinical dementia diagnosis. These findings suggest that time-domain analysis using Hjorth parameters could be an effective biomarker for early dementia detection, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings.

Brain metabolism is reduced in patients with dementia disorders, as demonstrated by hypometabolism on 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoroglucose ([(18)F]FDG) positron emissions tomography. A contributing factor to the hypometabolism could be decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) leading to a state of subtle hypoperfusion-induced tissue hypoxia causing a reduced brain oxygen metabolism and consequently elevated brain lactate. In the current exploratory study, we investigated brain lactate, global and regional CBF, and global cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLBs). We hypothesized that the patients demonstrate a state of tissue hypoxia with reduced CMRO(2) and elevated brain lactate concentration. Participants included 24 AD patients, 10 DLB patients, and 15 healthy controls. MR spectroscopy measured lactate in the precuneus and occipital lobe. Global CBF and venous oxygen saturation (for CMRO2 calculation) were assessed using phase-contrast and susceptibility-based oximetry MRI, respectively. Regional CBF was measured with ASL-MRI. We observed no significant difference in either brain lactate or CMRO(2) between groups. The regional CBF in precuneus was significantly lower in AD compared to HC; however, this hypoperfusion was not associated with a higher lactate concentration. The lack of a difference in CMRO(2) or lactate concentration between patients and controls suggests that the hypometabolism observed in patients with AD and DLB may reflect structural neurodegeneration and not a state of tissue hypoxia. The local decrease of CBF in precuneus in patients with AD may be due to a lower CBF demand due to neurodegeneration.

Vascular dementia (VaD), the second-leading cause of dementia, is primarily a white matter ischemic disease with no direct therapies. Cell-cell interactions within lesion sites dictate disease progression or repair. To elucidate key intercellular pathways, we employ a VaD mouse model with focal ischemia replicating many elements of the complex pathophysiology of human VaD combined with transcriptomic and functional analyses. By integrating cell-type-specific mouse VaD transcriptomes and human VaD single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data plus a custom ligand-receptor database (4,053 human and 2,032 mouse pairs), conserved dysregulated intercellular pathways in both species are identified. We demonstrate that two intercellular signaling systems, Serpine2-Lrp1 and CD39-A3AR, are disrupted in VaD. Reduced Serpine2 expression enhances oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation, promoting repair, while an A3AR-specific agonist-currently in clinical trials for psoriasis-restores tissue integrity and behavioral function in the VaD model. This study reveals intercellular signaling targets and provides a foundation for developing innovative therapies for VaD.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Chronic periodontitis and tooth loss contribute to cognitive decline. Since many biological processes are shared by loss of teeth and loss of pulps, this study investigated the potential association between loss of pulp and the development of dementia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted to investigate the association between dental treatment and the development of dementia. The records of dental treatment during the 10 years prior to the first diagnosis of dementia were extracted from the Elderly Cohort Database of the National Health Information Sharing Service of Korea. The independence of dementia compared to the number of pulps or teeth removed was evaluated using the chi-squared test. The subjects were grouped by the number of teeth or pulps treated, and their odds ratio for dementia was calculated. RESULTS: Analysis of 591,592 sessions for pulpectomy and 710,722 sessions for tooth extraction from 558,147 individuals revealed a significant association with Alzheimer's dementia, but not with vascular or unspecified dementia. The number of dementia patients based on the number of pulps or teeth extracted were significantly different across age groups. The odds ratios demonstrated a tendency to increase with the number of dental treatments and decrease with age at the time of diagnosis of dementia. The number of pulps removed to achieve a notable impact on Alzheimer's dementia was found to be lower than the number of teeth extracted. CONCLUSION: The loss of pulp increased incidence of Alzheimer's dementia, with the impact being more pronounced in younger geriatric groups.

BACKGROUND: The majority of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients who converted to dementia in later years have Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The second most common type of dementia is Lewy body (LB) dementia. OBJECTIVE: In this project, we are interested in identifying the risk factors that predict who will develop AD dementia or LB dementia in later years. METHODS: Cox proportional hazards model and machine learning survival methods for interval-censored data were used to identify the risk factors that predict the onset of dementia for MCI patients with AD or LB pathology. RESULTS: We found that orientation, memory, and irritability scores were useful in predicting AD dementia onset, while daily living, depression, and executive function scores were identified as strong predictors in the LB cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Different neurocognitive domains were predictive for conversion to dementia from MCI in patients with AD or LB pathology. The depression scale and functional activities were found to be predictive of LB dementia while irritability or lability severity score from Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire was associated with the onset of AD dementia.

OBJECTIVES: Distinguishing dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, particularly in patients with DLB and concomitant AD pathology (DLB/AD+), can be challenging and there is no specific MRI signature for DLB. The aim of this study is to examine the additional value of MRI-based brain volumetry in separating patients with DLB (AD+/-) from patients with AD and controls. METHODS: We included 1518 participants from four cohorts (ADC, ADNI, PDBP and PredictND); 147 were patients with DLB (n = 76, DLB/AD+; n = 71, DLB/AD-), 668 patients with AD dementia, and 703 controls. We used an automatic segmentation tool to compute volumes of 70 brain regions, for which age, sex, and head size-dependent z-scores were calculated. We compared individual regions between the diagnostic groups and evaluated whether combining multiple regions improves differentiation. To assess the diagnostic performance, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity. RESULTS: The classifier using the combination of 70 volumetric brain regions correctly classified 60% of patients with DLB and 70% of patients with AD dementia. For DLB vs. AD, the classifier produced an AUC of 0.80 (0.77-0.83), which outperformed the best individual region, hippocampus (AUC: 0.73 [0.69-0.76], p < 0.01). For the comparison of DLB/AD+ vs. AD, the classifier increased the AUC to 0.74 (0.68-0.80), which was 0.70 (0.64-0.76) for the hippocampus, p = 0.25. CONCLUSION: Using a combination of volumetric brain regions improved the classification accuracy, and thus the discrimination, of patients with DLB with and without concomitant AD pathology and AD. KEY POINTS: Question No specific MRI signature for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) exists, making the differential diagnosis challenging, especially with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Findings Volumes of individual brain regions defined by automatic MRI segmentation differed between DLB and AD patients and controls. Clinical relevance Automatic MRI segmentation can contribute to improving the discrimination of patients with DLB and AD, especially in non-specialized memory clinics.

OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the burden of mortality attributable to Alzheimer's dementia in the US for women and men. METHODS: Data came from 3,491 women and 1,160 men ages 65 and older (mean 76.5 for both sexes) with no dementia at baseline from five longitudinal cohort studies of aging with identical annual diagnostic assessments of dementia. Mortality hazard ratios (HR) after incident Alzheimer's dementia were estimated per 10-year age strata from proportional hazard models. Population attributable risk percent (PAR%) was derived to estimate excess mortality after a diagnosis of incident Alzheimer's dementia. Results were then stratified by self-reported sex, and separately with an interaction term for sex by incident Alzheimer's dementia. The number of excess deaths attributable to Alzheimer's dementia in the US for women and men by age group was then estimated. RESULTS: Over an average of 9 (SD=5.8) years, 954 (27.3%) women and 316 (27.2%) men without dementia at baseline developed Alzheimer's dementia; 1,792 (51.3%) women and 726 (62.6%) men died. In a model with terms for sex, race, education, incident Alzheimer's dementia, and interaction between male sex and Alzheimer's dementia, we observed an interaction (HR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.53) in the age strata 85+, indicating a higher risk of mortality due to Alzheimer's dementia for men; at lower ages the interaction was opposite (HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.52, 1.09 in age strata 75-84), indicating higher risk of mortality from Alzheimer's dementia for females. After further adjusting for vascular risk factors and diseases, the interactions were similar. PAR% was similar for age 85+ for women and men (33.4% and 32.9% respectively) but higher for women than men in the age strata 75-84 (24.2% and 19.1%). In 2023, we estimate 465,400 deaths-271,700 in women and 193,700 in men-were attributable to Alzheimer's dementia. Adjusted PAR%s that took account of differences in vascular risk factors and disease showed even larger gaps for women compared to men (41.3% vs 37.5% for age 85+ and 33.2% vs 16.3% for age 75-84), resulting in estimates of 349,409 deaths from AD for women and 198,724 for men. CONCLUSIONS: The number of deaths attributable to Alzheimer's dementia is estimated to be 270,000-350,000, making it one of the leading causes of death in women, on par with cancer. The number is about 200,000 in men which also makes it a leading cause of death, on a par with accidents but much lower than cancer.

BACKGROUND: Dementia-related stigma is a significant global health concern. However, public awareness and education about dementia-related stigma remain limited, especially on social media. Examining dementia-related stigma on social media is critical because it impacts how the public perceives people living with dementia. By understanding dementia-related stigma on social media, we can develop educational strategies to target false stereotypes, beliefs, and misinformation to improve the quality of life of people living with dementia. OBJECTIVE: This study examines dementia-related stigma on the X platform (formerly Twitter) during World Alzheimer's Month to identify opportunities for intervention to address dementia-related stigma. METHODS: A total of 266,211 posts were scraped from X during the World Alzheimer's Awareness Month from September 1-30, 2022, a global advocacy campaign organized by Alzheimer's Disease International. We used filters to exclude non-English content, duplicate posts, and reply posts with missing content. To ensure rigor and trustworthiness in the research, several measures were employed, ranging from peer debriefing sessions to documenting the research process. RESULTS: After filtering the data, 1981 posts were examined using thematic analysis. A total of four main themes were identified including: (i) dementia stereotypes: "a burden to society"; (ii) discrimination and denied dignity: "discrimination exists in public spaces"; (iii) devaluing the lives of people with dementia: "society should legalize euthanasia"; and (iv) countering dementia-related stigma: "break down the stigma." Although the World Alzheimer's Awareness Month is helpful for raising awareness, more research is needed to address dementia-related stigma, stereotypes, and discrimination on social media. CONCLUSIONS: By analyzing how stigma manifests on social media, our study sheds light on the dementia education and information needed to address false beliefs, misinformation, and dementia-related stigma. The findings from our study have important implications for policymakers, health professionals, and community advocates working to design awareness campaigns to reduce dementia-related stigma on social media.

OBJECTIVES: This study identifies neuropsychiatric syndromes and investigates their relationship with neuroimaging in Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging and perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography data were collected for 281, 68, and 180 patients with AD, DLB, and MCI, respectively, from three Japanese institutions. Neuropsychiatric Inventory was used for exploratory factor analysis in each group. Statistical Parametric Mapping was exploited to reveal the relationships between each factor score and cerebral volume or perfusion with age, sex, dementia severity, and the other factor scores as covariates. RESULTS: Three factors (psychosis, agitation, and affective disturbance) were extracted for AD. For DLB, nighttime behavior and aberrant motor behavior were extracted as independent symptoms with the same three factors. Four factors (psychosis, agitation, anxiety, and apathy) were extracted for MCI. A positive relationship between agitation and cerebral volume in the left middle frontal gyri and left caudate was observed in AD. In DLB, agitation was positively correlated with cerebral perfusion in the left dominant regions, including the middle frontal gyri and caudate. Psychosis and perfusion were negatively correlated in the left extent regions, including the temporo-parieto-occipital lobe, insula, and inferior frontal gyri in DLB. Psychosis was significantly associated with lower perfusion in the bilateral occipital lobes, whereas apathy was significantly correlated with a lower volume of the right dominant bilateral frontal lobes in MCI. CONCLUSIONS: Three neuropsychiatric syndromes - psychosis, agitation, and affective disturbance - may heterogeneously associate with AD, DLB, and MCI.

AIMS: The blood inflammatory marker interleukin 6 (IL-6) has been shown to predict future stroke, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), and dementia. However, no study has yet examined this relationship in the same population. The present study compared the predictive utility of IL-6 levels in stroke, MACEs, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. METHODS: In this post-hoc analysis, we derived data from a Japanese observational registry in which 1011 patients with evidence of cerebral vessel disease were enrolled. After excluding patients who required assistance with daily tasks, were suspected of having dementia, and lacked IL-6 measurement, 471 patients were included. The patients were followed up until March 2023. The outcomes were incident stroke, MACEs, and AD dementia. RESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 4.6 years, stroke, MACEs, and AD dementia occurred in 24, 36, and 21 patients, respectively. Serum IL-6 levels are associated with age, sex, and vascular factors. A Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed that the highest IL-6 tertile (≥ 2.5 pg/mL) was associated with a significantly higher risk of stroke and MACEs than the lowest IL-6 tertile after adjusting for confounding factors (stroke, adjusted hazard ratio 4.84 [95% confidence interval, 1.02-23.05], P = 0.048; MACEs, adjusted hazard ratio 3.68 [95% confidence interval, 1.01-13.51], P = 0.049). However, no association was found between IL-6 tertile groups and AD dementia. CONCLUSION: Serum IL-6 levels predicted stroke and cardiovascular events but not AD dementia in patients with vascular risk factors. The involvement of low-grade systemic inflammation appears to be significantly greater in atherothrombotic events than that in AD dementia.

BACKGROUND: With the availability of first disease-modifying treatments, evidence on costs across the entire Alzheimer's Continuum, especially for early disease stages, becomes increasingly important to inform healthcare planning, resource allocation, and policy decisions. This study assessed costs and cost-associated factors in patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) dementia compared to healthy controls. METHODS: The German DELCODE cohort study assessed clinical data, healthcare resource use, and informal care provision. Costs were calculated from payer and societal perspectives using standardized unit costs, and multivariate regression analyses identified cost-associated factors. RESULTS: From a payer perspective, costs were elevated by 26% for SCD (adjusted mean 5,976€ [95%CI 4,598-7,355€]), 85% for MCI (8,795€ [6,200-11,391€]) and 36% for AD (6,454€ [2,796-10,111€]) compared to controls (4,754€ [3,586-5,922€]). Societal costs were elevated by 52% for SCD (adjusted mean 8,377€ [95%CI 6,009-10,746€]), 170% for MCI (14,886€ [9,524-20,248€]) and 307% for AD (22,481€ [9,994-34,969€]) compared to controls (5,522€ [3,814-7,230€]). APOE e4 negative patients showed higher costs compared to APOE e4 positive patients. Hypertension was associated with higher costs. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare costs are already elevated in early subjective and objective cognitive impairment, driven by formal and informal care. The study emphasizes the importance of early interventions to reduce the economic burden and delay progression.

INTRODUCTION: Asymptomatic extracranial carotid artery disease (aECAD) is associated with increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD dementia risk. aECAD treatment includes carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) for stroke prevention, but their impact on dementia incidence is poorly studied. METHODS: Propensity score matching was used in a retrospective cohort study of United States-based insurance claims (2010-2022) in 487,676 patients with aECAD to evaluate the effect of CEA and CAS on AD and non-AD dementia incidence. RESULTS: After matching, 37,317 patients underwent CEA or CAS. CEA was associated with a significantly lower AD risk (relative risk = 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.99; P < 0.05), whereas CAS was associated with a slight but non-significant increase. Similar trends were observed for non-AD dementia. DISCUSSION: CEA, but not CAS, may confer a protective effect against AD and non-AD dementia in patients with aECAD, a common cerebrovascular disease affecting up to 15% of adults over age 60. HIGHLIGHTS: Asymptomatic extracranial carotid artery disease (aECAD) is associated with increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD dementia risk. Limited studies have evaluated the role of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and (carotid artery stenting (CAS) on dementia outcomes. Using United States-based insurance claims data, 487,676 patients with aECAD were evaluated. After propensity score matching, CEA was significantly associated with reduced AD risk. CAS was not significantly associated with a change in AD risk.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an established risk factor for cognitive impairment. The specific role of HHcy in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is debated, as most of the suspected mechanisms overlap with those of vascular dementia (VD). The aim of this study was to explore the association between plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD, as well as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features. Cross-sectional observational analysis from a single-center tertiary memory clinic. We first assessed the association between Hcy in tertiles and the CSF AD biomarkers (according to the Amyloid (A) Tau (T) Neurodegeneration (N) classification) with further adjustments for age and sex. Then, we analyzed the relationship between HHcy and hippocampal atrophy (Scheltens scale) and white matter lesions (WML) (Fazekas scale) on brain MRI. We included 507 patients [mean age 68.9 (standard deviation=8.9)] with mean plasma Hcy at 13.3 (4.7) μmol/L in this study. There was no significant association between Hcy tertiles and CSF AD biomarkers. Plasma Hcy levels showed no correlation with any CSF AD biomarkers. The severity of WML increased with higher Hcy tertiles (p&;lt0.0001). Patients with a CSF AD (A+T+) profile exhibited elevated mean Hcy levels when they presented moderate to severe WML (p&;lt0.0001). Our findings challenge the link between Hcy and AD pathophysiology while highlighting a significant connection between Hcy and microvascular cognitive impairment. Further longitudinal studies are needed to validate these conclusions.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) frequently coexists with Alzheimer's disease pathology, yet the pattern of cortical microstructural injury and its relationship with amyloid, tau, and cerebrovascular pathologies remains unclear. We applied neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) to assess cortical microstructural integrity in 57 individuals within the DLB spectrum and 57 age- and sex-matched cognitively unimpaired controls by quantifying mean diffusivity (MD), tissue-weighted neurite density index (tNDI), orientation dispersion index (ODI), and free water fraction (FWF). Amyloid and tau levels were measured using PiB and Flortaucipir PET imaging. Compared to controls, DLB exhibited increased MD and FWF, reduced tNDI across multiple regions, and focal ODI reductions in the occipital cortex. Structural equation modeling revealed that APOE genotype influenced amyloid levels, which elevated tau, leading to microstructural injury. These findings highlight the role of AD pathology in DLB neurodegeneration, advocating for multi-target therapeutic approaches addressing both AD and DLB-specific pathologies.

INTRODUCTION: Whether temporal proximity to parental onset of dementia (PPO) can be used to estimate timing of the preclinical stage of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains uncertain. METHODS: We investigated cross-sectionally adults aged > 50 without dementia included in the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia (EPAD) study. PPO was tested as a predictor of quantitative levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β-amyloid (1-42) (Aβ1-42) in those with a parental history of dementia (n = 688) and of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and EPAD neuropsychological examination (ENE) subscores in an amyloid positive subgroup (n = 226). Possible interactions were explored. RESULTS: Shorter PPO predicted lower CSF Aβ1-42 level (β = 9.357; T = 4.161; p < 0.001), interacting with apolipoprotein E (APOE) -𝜀4 carriage in a dose-dependent manner. Concomitant APOE-𝜀2 carriage appeared to provide protection. PPO did not predict p-tau levels or cognitive performance. DISCUSSION: PPO may provide a valid method of stratifying risk of early AD pathologic change in APOE-𝜀4 carriers, with empirical and clinical applications. HIGHLIGHTS: Proximity to age of parental dementia onset can predict amyloid accrualThe effect is APOE-𝜀4 dose-dependent and APOE-𝜀2 appears to provide protectionPPO does not appear to predict further advancement along the AD continuumIn the era of anti-amyloid treatments, this may inform timing of amyloid screeningUsed as an empirical metric, PPO could help elucidate the natural history of LOAD.

AIMS: Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) have beneficial effects on the heart. Associations between ChEI-use and reduced mortality and cardiovascular events in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been shown. Whether these associations exist in those with both heart failure (HF) and AD is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: A propensity score (PS) matched cohort with patients with HF and AD was obtained through linking registers for cognitive/dementia disorders, comorbidities, drug prescription, and death, in Sweden, to analyse associations between ChEI-use and risk of mortality or hospitalization for HF, stroke, or myocardial infarction, were examined. In 455 patients with and 455 without ChEI treatment, ChEI use was associated with reductions of mortality and hospitalization due to HF by 21% [0.79; (confidence interval) CI 0.66-0.96] and 47% (0.53; CI 0.38-0.75), respectively. Donepezil and galantamine but not rivastigmine were associated with a lower risk of death compared with non-users. Donepezil was associated with a lower risk of hospitalization due to HF compared with non-users. There was no significant difference in hospitalization for bradycardia, AV block, or implantation of pacemaker between ChEI use and non-use. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that in persons with HF and AD, treatment with ChEIs is associated with improved survival and a decreased risk of hospital care for HF, but results due to the type of ChEI vary.

BackgroundThe data that we gathered from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction tool, FpClass, and a limited number of studies indicated that the chaperones HSP90AA1, HSPA4, STUB1/CHIP might interact with amyloid-β (Aβ) and/or tau and could subsequently be co-released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Therefore, we investigated CSF levels of HSP90AA1, HSPA4, and STUB1/CHIP in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Non-AD mild cognitive impairment (Non-AD MCI), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases.MethodsThe CSF levels of HSP90AA1, HSPA4, STUB/CHIP, and core AD biomarkers were determined by ELISA in AD (n = 90), Non-AD MCI (n = 27), FTD (n = 15), and subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) (n = 20) subjects.ResultsHSP90AA1 levels were significantly higher in AD cases compared to the SCI subjects. The CSF levels of STUB1/CHIP were significantly lower in AD, Non-AD MCI and FTD cases compared to the SCI subjects. STUB1/CHIP levels of FTD cases were significantly lower than all other groups. HSPA4 levels was correlated with core AD biomarkers (Aβ 1-42, p-Tau, t-Tau) regardless of disease. Non-APOE ε4 carrier FTD cases also had significantly lower STUB1/CHIP levels than other groups.ConclusionsThe STUB1/CHIP holds promise as a potential biomarker for distinguishing between SCI subjects, AD, and FTD. Furthermore, APOE might serve as an additional discriminatory factor that might be integrated with this chaperone for enhanced discrimination.

OBJECTIVE: This study in Taiwan examined the association between oral health factors and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, including subjective cognitive decline (SCD). METHODS: Eighty-one participants aged 60 and older were recruited and divided into four groups: control, SCD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. Oral health parameters, including number of missing teeth, masticatory performance, occlusal support (Eichner index), and periodontal status, were evaluated through clinical examinations. Cognitive function was assessed using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Logistic regression analyzed associations between oral health and dementia severity, while ordered logistic regression evaluated the impact of oral health on dementia progression. A two-way ANOVA assessed variations in cognitive scores across diagnostic categories and Eichner index classifications. RESULTS: Adjusted odds ratios (OR_adj) for natural tooth loss (>14 teeth lost versus 1-13 teeth lost) were 1.45, 4.69, and 10.18 times for the SCD, MCI, and AD groups, respectively, in comparison to the control group. Unrestored teeth after fixed prostheses and the loss of occlusal supportive zones were strongly associated with MCI and AD. Participants with SCD in Eichner categories B and C had lower MoCA scores than those in category A, although no similar trend was observed in the MMSE. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that maintaining occlusal support may help mitigate cognitive decline. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: "Unrestored teeth and loss of occlusal support were linked to cognitive decline." These findings underscore the clinical relevance of routine oral assessments and timely prosthetic rehabilitation in mitigating cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND: Developing non-invasive and affordable biomarkers to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) at a prodromal stage is essential, particularly in the context of new disease-modifying therapies. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a critical stage preceding dementia, but not all patients with MCI will progress to AD. This study explores the potential of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to predict cognitive decline from MCI to AD dementia. METHODS: We analysed resting-state MEG data from the BioFIND dataset including 117 patients with MCI among whom 64 developed AD dementia (AD progression), while 53 remained cognitively stable (stable MCI), using spectral analysis. Logistic regression models estimated the additive explanation of selected clinical, MEG, and MRI variables for AD progression risk. We then built a high-dimensional classification model to combine all modalities and variables of interest. FINDINGS: MEG 16-38Hz spectral power, particularly over parieto-occipital magnetometers, was significantly reduced in the AD progression group. In logistic regression models, decreased MEG 16-38Hz spectral power and reduced hippocampal volume/total grey matter ratio on MRI were independently linked to higher AD progression risk. The data-driven classification model confirmed, among other factors, the complementary information of MEG covariance (AUC = 0.74, SD = 0.13) and MRI cortical volumes (AUC = 0.77, SD = 0.14) to predict AD progression. Combining all inputs led to markedly improved classification scores (AUC = 0.81, SD = 0.12). INTERPRETATION: These findings highlight the potential of spectral power and covariance as robust non-invasive electrophysiological biomarkers to predict AD progression, complementing other diagnostic measures, including cognitive scores and MRI.

OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies, the prodromal phase of dementia with Lewy bodies, and management of the disease. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: The diagnostic criteria and characterization of syndromes for prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies facilitate earlier recognition of individuals at risk of Lewy body dementia. Earlier diagnosis may prevent iatrogenic complications, guide families to seek appropriate resources, and provide an opportunity for future therapeutic interventions in the clinical prodrome. Advances in biomarkers include the detection of phosphorylated α-synuclein in cutaneous nerve fibers and the CSF α-synuclein seed amplification assay. ESSENTIAL POINTS: Dementia with Lewy bodies is a complex disease that requires an interdisciplinary approach to optimize diagnosis and management. Frequently occurring copathology, most commonly with Alzheimer disease, leads to greater cognitive decline, increased likelihood of admission to a long-term care facility, and a higher risk of mortality. Use of available biomarkers may better guide appropriate diagnosis and management.

A 78-year-old man with moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia was treated with nasal-foralumab, a fully human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, as part of a Food and Drug Administration expanded-access-program, based on previously demonstrated efficacy of anti-CD3 antibody in animal models. 18 F-PBR06-PET, utilizing a second-generation 18-kDa-translocator-protein ligand targeting microglia, showed diffuse reduction of radiotracer uptake throughout the brain, following 3 months of nasal-foralumab compared with baseline. In particular, precuneus, posterior cingulate and anterior cingulate gyri, regions that had high levels of amyloid deposition on a baseline 18 F-Florbetapir-PET scan, showed reduction in microglial activation after nasal-foralumab treatment for 3 months.

Dementia is a broad category of neurodegenerative pathologies characterized by a progressive decline in two or more cognitive domains, including memory, language, executive and visuospatial functions, personality, and behavior, resulting in the loss of the ability to perform instrumental and/or basic daily activities. One of the most common types of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Current approved treatments for Alzheimer's disease are mainly limited to alleviating cognitive, behavioral, and psychological deficits. To date, four drugs belonging to two families have been approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine) and antiglutamatergic drugs (memantine). Drugs delay the progression of the disease, but they cause a number of side effects. Many scientific studies have focused on finding natural products with potential neuroprotective properties and no or minimal cytotoxicity that can support current drug therapy. The main objective of this review is to analyze and describe the neuroprotective potential of selected groups of natural substances (polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenoids) in one of the commonly performed in vivo studies, the scopolamine-induced animal model of Alzheimer's disease. The article is a review of literature reports from the last 5 years, and the information collected indicates that the neuroprotective activity of natural compounds may prove to be a potential alternative or add-on for Alzheimer's disease therapy.

BACKGROUND: Recent disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease show promise to slow cognitive decline, but show no efficacy towards reducing symptoms already manifested. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy of a novel noninvasive brain stimulation technique in modulating cognitive functioning in Alzheimer's dementia (AD). DESIGN: Pilot, randomized, double-blind, parallel, sham-controlled study SETTING: Clinical research site at UT Southwestern Medical Center PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five participants with clinical diagnoses of AD were enrolled from cognition specialty clinics. INTERVENTION: Treatment consisted of high definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) delivered for 20 min over the medial prefrontal cortex. Ten sessions of sham, 1 mA, or 2 mA stimulation were received. MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive outcomes were measured at baseline, after the last HD-tDCS session, and 8-weeks post-treatment. The primary outcome was change in total learning and delayed recall on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) immediately post-treatment and at 8-weeks. Secondary outcomes included measures of language, processing speed, and executive functioning. A multi-stage approach was used to examine cognitive outcomes, which included evaluation of effect sizes, statistical effects, and rate of clinically meaningful responses. RESULTS: In this pilot trial, no statistically significant differences on cognitive outcomes were found between sham and active HD-tDCS immediately post-treatment (p's > 0.05). However, moderate-to-large effect sizes were identified for enhanced RAVLT total learning (Cohen's d = 0.69-0.93) and phonemic fluency (d = 1.08-1.49) for both active HD-tDCS conditions compared to sham, with rates of clinically relevant improvement between 25 and 33%. Meaningful enhancement persisted to 8 weeks only for the 1 mA condition. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple sessions of HD-tDCS over the medial prefrontal cortex appears to have potential to produce meaningful cognitive enhancements in a proportion of patients having AD with improvements maintained for at least 8 weeks in some.

INTRODUCTION: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease dementia (EOAD) is characterized by more pronounced cognitive decline than late-onset AD dementia (LOAD). Characteristic performance in spoken language remains undefined. METHOD: A cross-sectional analysis of 1189 people with EOAD and 4646 with LOAD from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) was conducted. RESULT: Based on data from their first NACC visit with AD, there was considerable heterogeneity in language performance across people with EOAD and LOAD. The distribution of naming ability was similar across these groups. On average, people with LOAD performed better than those with EOAD in category fluency, letter fluency, and spoken lexical retrieval, and had lower Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Language scores, although there was considerable overlap in the distributions for participants with EOAD and those with LOAD. DISCUSSION: At diagnosis, the language profiles of EOAD and LOAD are distinct. There is substantial variability in both groups in multiple aspects of language. HIGHLIGHTS: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) is associated with significantly poorer category and phonemic fluency and global spoken lexical retrieval compared to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) at time of diagnosis. Participants with EOAD dementia show greater severity and variability in clinician-rated language functioning, as measured by Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Language scores. No significant group differences were observed in confrontation naming performance between EOAD and LOAD dementia. Findings support that there are distinct profiles of language performance in EOAD and LOAD at time of dementia diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two types of dementia with a relatively high incidence, and their clinical manifestations are easily confused. However, the cognitive impairment characteristics of the two diseases are different, and the results of cognitive assessment can help the diagnosis of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To explore the different characteristics of Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) in DLB and AD patients, and to explore potential markers to distinguish AD and DLB. METHODS: This study included 66 patients with DLB, 81 with AD, and 58 cognitively normal subjects. All of them completed MMSE, MoCA, and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). RESULTS: Compared with NC, both DLB and AD participants demonstrated statistically lower scores in the total and subitem domains of MMSE and MoCA (p < 0.05). When CDR was less than 2, DLB patients had better performance than AD in two subtests including memory and orientation (p < 0.05), demonstrated worse performance in most subtest including executive function, writing, visuospatial abilities, and attention (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, no notable distinction in scores existed for the DLB and AD groups with a CDR score of 2 (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: We observed distinct cognitive performances in subjects from both the DLB and AD groups across different stages of dementia. Our study confirms the high value of MMSE and MoCA in distinguishing patients with DLB and AD in the early stages of the disease, and they can improve the differential diagnosis of DLB and AD.

BackgroundDeclining physical functionality is an indicator of cognitive impairment, distinguishing normal cognition (NC) from dementia. Whether this extends to pre-dementia stages is unclear.ObjectiveAssess physical performance patterns, evaluate relationships with imaging biomarkers, and identify specific measures distinguishing NC, subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).MethodsGroup differences (78 NC, 35 SCD, and 41 MCI) in physical function (global function, balance, gait speed, step length, single leg support) were evaluated with logistic regression while distinguishing between MCI due-to-AD and MCI due-to-vascular etiology. Relationships with imaging biomarkers (cortical atrophy score, white matter hyperintensities volumes) were analyzed with ANCOVA.ResultsParticipants were 68.6 ± 9.3 years old, had 16.2 ± 3.0 years of education, and 23% were ethnoracial minorities. Physical performance distinguished MCI from NC and SCD. Greater performance on the Mini Physical Performance Test (mini PPT) and balance were associated with lower odds of being SCD versus NC (OR(mini PPT) = 0.73; 95% CI:0.56-0.97; OR(balance) = 0.35, 95%CI:0.16-0.80). AD etiology accounted for most group differences in physical performance versus vascular etiology. Consistent associations between biomarkers, physical performance, and cognition were found.ConclusionsFindings suggest that: 1) changes in mini PPT performance and balance may help detect cognitive impairments, as early as the SCD stage; 2) changes in gait speed, gait cycle parameters, and Timed Up-and-Go may indicate more significant cognitive impairment; 3) neuronal loss is linked to subtle changes in physical functionality as early as SCD. Physical performance may be a valuable tool in early dementia detection in clinical settings and could identify targets for early intervention.

BACKGROUND: Readily available treatments for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. Non-adherence and early discontinuation of anti-dementia medications are prevalent issues. We aimed to investigate factors associated with suboptimal usage of anti-dementia medications in ADRD. METHODS: Based on data extracted from a claim database in South Korea, 508,958 patients with ADRD who began taking anti-dementia medication between 2018 and 2020 were included. The mean possession ratio is the ratio of the sum of prescribed medication supply over one year and non-adherence is defined as mean possession ratio < 80%. Discontinuation is defined as no prescription of anti-dementia medications, or no switch to other anti-dementia medications, within 45 days after the run-out date. The cumulative incidence of discontinuation of anti-dementia medication was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Factors associated with non-adherence were evaluated using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Within the first year, the non-adherence ratio was 40.8%, while the discontinuation ratio was 43.6%, and approximately 30% of patients discontinued medication within 90 days after initiation. Younger age at diagnosis, female sex, and prescription at non-tertiary hospitals or clinics other than neurology/psychiatry were associated with increased risk of non-adherence. Compared with Seoul, a prescription issued by neurology/psychiatry departments at a tertiary hospital in other provinces was associated with a 75% higher risk of non-adherence. CONCLUSION: Strategies targeting non-adherence are warranted to minimize disparities in the management of patients with dementia.

OBJECTIVES: Intrinsic capacity (IC), the composite of all the physical and mental capacities of an individual, has never been studied in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). As IC decline is associated with the risk of frailty, functional decline and disability and is potentially reversible after targeted interventions, a monitoring and specific management of IC decline in patients with DLB could promote healthy aging in this population. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to describe the frequency of IC decline in DLB and to compare it with AD. DESIGN: A single-center cross-sectional study. SETTING: This study was carried out in a memory clinic between 2015 and 2023 based on the MEMORA cohort. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a diagnosis of AD or probable DLB and a comprehensive geriatric assessment. MEASUREMENTS: IC was assessed according to the WHO model in 4 domains: vitality assessed by the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), locomotion assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), psychology assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale 4-items (GDS-4 items), and hearing assessed by the Hearing, Vision, Equilibrium and Cognition (HVEC) scale. RESULTS: A total of 798 patients (154 with probable DLB and 644 with AD) were included, and the mean age was 81.4 years (SD 6.33). Compared with AD patients, DLB patients had significantly more impaired IC in all domains, with greater risks of impaired vitality (odds ratio (OR) 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60-3.72), locomotion (OR 3.50, 95% CI 2.15-5.90), psychology (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.73-3.92) and hearing (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.53-3.49), according to the adjusted models. Similarly, when IC domains were considered linear variables, IC across all domains was significantly lower in the DLB group than in the AD group. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that DLB patients presented a greater decrease in IC than did AD patients across all domains. In memory clinics, DLB patients could be offered systematic and early IC monitoring and personalized interventions.

Although inflammation and oxidative stress have been increasingly recognised as components of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) pathologies. Few studies have investigated peripheral inflammation, and none have examined oxidative stress in Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The purpose of our study was to characterize and compare those biomarkers in DLB with those in AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Plasma samples were obtained from Chinese patients with DLB (n = 50), AD (n = 59), and aMCI (n = 30), and healthy controls (HCs) (n = 54). Peripheral inflammatory biomarkers, including interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukins (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Oxidative stress markers, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), were also assessed. The findings revealed that DLB patients had higher IL-6 levels than AD and HCs and elevated IL-10 and IL-17A levels compared to HCs. In terms of oxidative stress, the levels of SOD were significantly lower and MDA were significantly higher in the DLB and AD compared with HCs. Significant positive correlations were found between Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and CRP levels. Our study identifies a unique peripheral immune and oxidative stress profile in DLB, characterized by elevated IL-6, MDA, and reduced SOD levels, distinguishing it from AD. These findings, linked to α-synuclein (α-Syn) pathology, provide novel insights into DLB mechanisms and highlight potential biomarkers for disease monitoring, targeted therapies, and future clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION: Whole genome methylation sequencing (WGMS) in blood identifies differential DNA methylation in persons with late-onset dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) but has not been tested in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: We used WGMS to compare DNA methylation levels at 25,244,219 CpG loci in 382 blood samples from 99 persons with MCI, 109 with AD, and 174 who are cognitively unimpaired (CU). RESULTS: WGMS identified 9756 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in persons with MCI, including 1743 differentially methylated genes encoding proteins in biological pathways related to synapse organization, dendrite development, and ion transport. A total of 447 DMPs exhibit progressively increasing or decreasing DNA methylation levels among CU, MCI, and AD that correspond to cognitive status. DISCUSSION: WGMS identifies DMPs in known and newly detected genes in blood from persons with MCI and AD that support blood DNA methylation levels can distinguish cognitive status. HIGHLIGHTS: Whole genome methylation levels in blood from 99 persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 109 with Alzheimer's disease, and 174 who are cognitively unimpaired were analyzed. Nine thousand seven hundred fifty-six differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were identified in MCI. One thousand seven hundred forty-three genes comprise one or more DMPs in persons with MCI. Fifty-eight DMPs and 392 differentially methylated genes are shared among the three pairwise comparisons. Four hundred forty-seven DMPs exhibit progressive changes that correspond to cognitive status.

OBJECTIVES: The Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) is a widely used tool for assessing executive function. However, its ability to distinguish between Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) remains under debate. This study assessed the diagnostic utility of the Chilean version of the FAB (FAB-Ch) in differentiating ADD from bvFTD and used data-driven cluster analysis to explore dysexecutive profiles. METHOD: A total of 288 participants were recruited: 45 with ADD, 33 with bvFTD, and 208 cognitively unimpaired controls (CU). Mean FAB-Ch total scores were compared across groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves evaluated the instrument's ability to distinguish (i) dementia from no dementia, (ii) ADD from bvFTD, and (iii) executive dysfunction. Hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted to identify executive profiles among dementia patients. RESULTS: FAB-Ch scores were significantly lower in individuals with dementia compared to controls (p < .001). However, there were no significant differences between ADD and bvFTD groups (p = .59). The FAB-Ch showed strong discriminatory power between dementia and controls (AUC = 0.882; sensitivity = 0.731; specificity = 0.885), but poor discrimination between ADD and bvFTD (AUC = 0.465; p = .59). Cluster analysis among patients with dementia revealed three distinct executive profiles corresponding to different levels of cognitive impairment (p < .001). CONCLUSION: The FAB-Ch effectively differentiates individuals with dementia from cognitively unimpaired controls but does not distinguish between ADD and bvFTD. Nevertheless, it is sensitive to executive dysfunction and can aid in the clinical characterization of dementia severity and heterogeneity.

Frontotemporal dementia is a complex neurodegenerative illness characterized by a progressive deterioration in temperament, judgement, behaviour, and communication. Misdiagnosis and late diagnosis occur frequently due to the complexity of the phenotypes, overlaps of features with other neurodegenerative syndromes and psychiatric disorders, and ill-defined preclinical phases of the illness. Diagnosis relies on structural or functional brain imaging to show characteristic atrophy, hypoperfusion or hypometabolism profiles. The sensitivity of neuroimaging is lower in the earliest phases of the illness, and there are few alternatives. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely available, low-cost technology, but its utility in the differential diagnosis of dementia will require EEG indices of high sensitivity and discriminatory value. We have used scalp EEG to develop subject-specific Dynamic Network Models, from which we summarize the reciprocal relationships between the nodes (defined by the EEG channel). This index, the 'Sink-Index', characterizes how activity in each node (or channel) responds to activity in other nodes in the network. In this context, 'sources' are nodes that exert significant influence on the activity of different regions but are not themselves influenced, whereas 'sinks' represent influenced regions that do not affect activity in others. We hypothesized that brain regions associated with Frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease syndromes behave as sinks and have higher sink indices than healthy brain regions. This hypothesis was tested in a cohort of 88 subjects: 23 with frontotemporal dementia, 36 with Alzheimer's disease, and 29 healthy controls. The Sink-Index of nodes in the frontal-temporal and central-parietal-occipital brain regions differed between Frontotemporal dementia (1.3389 ± 0.0895 versus 0.8444 ± 0.0651), Alzheimer's disease (0.6015 ± 0.0188 versus 0.7766 ± 0.0158), and healthy controls (0.8978 ± 0.0453 versus 0.9116 ± 0.0457). These findings suggest the Sink-Index is an EEG marker with utility for the differential diagnosis of dementia syndromes.

INTRODUCTION: The locus coeruleus (LC) is linked to the development and pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Magnetic resonance imaging-based LC features have shown potential to assess LC integrity in vivo. METHODS: We present a deep learning-based LC segmentation and feature extraction method called Ensemble-based Locus Coeruleus Segmentation Network (ELSI-Net) and apply it to healthy aging and AD dementia datasets. Agreement to expert raters and previously published LC atlases were assessed. We aimed to reproduce previously reported differences in LC integrity in aging and AD dementia and correlate extracted features to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD pathology. RESULTS: ELSI-Net demonstrated high agreement to expert raters and published atlases. Previously reported group differences in LC integrity were detected and correlations to CSF biomarkers were found. DISCUSSION: Although we found excellent performance, further evaluations on more diverse datasets from clinical cohorts are required for a conclusive assessment of ELSI-Net's general applicability. HIGHLIGHTS: We provide a thorough evaluation of a fully automatic locus coeruleus (LC) segmentation method termed Ensemble-based Locus Coeruleus Segmentation Network (ELSI-Net) in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia.ELSI-Net outperforms previous work and shows high agreement with manual ratings and previously published LC atlases.ELSI-Net replicates previously shown LC group differences in aging and AD.ELSI-Net's LC mask volume correlates with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD pathology.

BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests there may be a bidirectional relationship between high blood pressure (BP) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is hypothesised that this is due to cerebral changes during pre-clinical AD that cause elevation of systemic BP. We aimed to test this by exploring the effect of risk of pre-clinical AD on blood pressure. METHODS: We used data from the UK Biobank, including adults without prevalent or incident (within first 5 years of follow-up) clinical AD (N = 501,420, mean age 56.6, SD 8 years). We used two instrumental variables, an age-weighted parental dementia instrument score and a participant genetic instrument score, that are vulnerable to differing biases, to instrument risk of pre-clinical AD (the exposure). We tested the association of both instrument scores with systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and hypertension. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to explore different biases. RESULTS: Both the higher parental dementia instrument and participant genetic instrument score were associated with higher mean SBP (difference in mean SBP mmHg per 1SD higher score: 0.12, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.17, p < 0.0001, and 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.13, p=0.037, respectively) but not DBP. Sensitivity analyses were largely consistent with these findings.  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide preliminary evidence that pre-clinical AD increases SBP. Further research is required to determine whether this increase in SBP is due to increased cerebrovascular resistance as a result of pre-clinical AD. Obtaining a better understanding of the changing relationship with BP at different stages of AD may enable effective optimisation and targeting of therapies.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to identify the risk factors that contribute to sex differences in patients with Alzheimer dementia (AD), specifically focusing on Early-Onset Alzheimer's Dementia (EAOD) and Late-Onset Alzheimer Dementia (LOAD). Additionally, the study aims to determine whether these risk factors differ between male and female EAOD and LOAD patients. METHODS: Our retrospective cohort study included a total of 6,212 patients diagnosed with either EOAD or LOAD from February 2016 to August 2020. Among this population, 687 patients (11.06%) were diagnosed with EOAD, while 5,525 patients (88.94%) had LOAD. We conducted a univariate analysis to identify differences in risk factors between male and female AD patients. A multivariate analysis was also performed to predict specific risk factors associated with male and female EOAD and LOAD patients. RESULTS: In the adjusted analysis, males with LOAD were found to have significantly higher odds of several comorbidities, including dyslipidemia [Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.720, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.489-1.987, p < 0.001], peripheral vascular disease (OR = 2.324, 95% CI = 1.828-2.955, p < 0.001), obstructive sleep apnea (OR = 2.330, 95% CI = 1.768-3.070, p < 0.001), and pneumonia (OR = 1.235, 95% CI = 1.004-1.520, p = 0.046). In contrast, females with LOAD were associated with lower odds of having hypertension (OR = 0.715, 95% CI = 0.623-0.820, p < 0.001), osteoporosis (OR = 0.310, 95% CI = 0.254-0.380, p < 0.001), urinary tract infections (OR = 0.638, 95% CI = 0.521-0.782, p < 0.001), congestive heart failure (OR = 0.626, 95% CI = 0.481-0.815, p < 0.001), and rheumatoid arthritis. In male patients with EAOD the analysis indicated a strong association with gait dysfunction (OR = 10.797, 95% CI = 3.257-35.792, p < 0.001), peripheral vascular disease (OR = 3.835, 95% CI = 1.767-8.321, p < 0.001), and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (OR = 5.984, 95% CI = 2.186-16.381, p < 0.001). Conversely, females with EOAD were associated with significantly lower odds of experiencing cerebrovascular accidents (OR = 0.347, 95% CI = 0.155-0.778, p < 0.001), osteoporosis (OR = 0.345, 95% CI = 0.155-0.778, p = 0.030), and anxiety (OR = 0.412, 95% CI = 0.203-0.833, p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate sex differences in the risk factors for EAOD and LOAD patients. Understanding these risk factors can help us develop strategies to improve diagnostic accuracy, create targeted interventions, and enhance clinical outcomes for both male and female EAOD and LOAD patients.

INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the long-term effects of daily 40 Hz (gamma frequency) audiovisual stimulation on cognition and biomarkers in five patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Over 2 years, patients received 1-h daily stimulation. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to assess neural entrainment; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measured brain volumes; actigraphy monitored activity patterns; neuropsychological tests evaluated cognition; and S-PLEX assay measured plasma pTau217. RESULTS: No adverse events occurred over the study period. Three female patients with late-onset AD (LOAD) retained strong EEG entrainment and showed less decline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and Functional Assessment Scale (FAS) scores compared to matched controls from National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS). Plasma samples were available for only two of five participants - both with LOAD - and both showed pTau217 reductions of 47% and 19%. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that long-term 40 Hz audiovisual stimulation is safe, feasible, and may offer cognitive and biomarker benefits in some individuals with mild AD, supporting further investigation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04055376). HIGHLIGHTS: Five mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients safely used daily 40 Hz audiovisual stimulation for 2 years. Late-onset AD (LOAD) patients showed increased 40 Hz electroencephalography (EEG) power and improved cognitive scores. National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) data enhanced early-phase analysis and support precision medicine in AD studies. Plasma pTau217 declined in 2 LOAD patients after 2 years of daily use. This small pilot is the first to link long-term 40 Hz therapy to AD biomarker change.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a spectrum of clinical syndromes characterized by neuronal degeneration involving the frontal and anterior temporal lobes of the brain. In patients age ≥ 65, it is the third most common cause of dementia and is the second most common cause of early-onset dementia (age <65) and usually involves patients with age ranges from 45 to 65. Arnold Pick was the first to report frontotemporal associated clinical syndromes in 1892. Onari and Hugo Spatz coined the term “Picks disease” in 1926 for frontotemporal lobe atrophy with the presence of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies known as Pick bodies. It was later replaced by the term FTD based on distinct clinical and histopathological criteria, assigned by a research group from the United Kingdom and Sweden in 1994. FTD targets brain areas that are responsible for personality, behavior, language learning, motivation, abstract thinking, and executive function. Behavior changes and/or language difficulty are the presenting clinical features followed by loss of executive function and cognitive abilities. It is classified into two distinct clinical types; behavior variant (bvFTD) and language type. The language type of FTD is further classified into non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) depending on the areas of neuronal loss in frontal and temporal lobes.

INTRODUCTION: The development of blood biomarkers for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents one of the most significant recent advances, and some are already available for clinical practice. Therefore, the Grupo de Estudio de Conducta y Demencias de la Sociedad Española de Neurología has formed a working group to review the current status and develop consensus recommendations for their clinical implementation. DEVELOPMENT: This document was prepared by neurologists from the Grupo de Estudio de Conducta y Demencias de la Sociedad Española de Neurología in two phases. First, a coordinating group defined the basic guidelines of the document, agreed on initial recommendations based on a literature review, and drafted a preliminary version. Subsequently, the proposal was reviewed by the entire working group, all comments were considered, and the coordinating group adjusted the recommendations until consensus was achieved among the participants. CONCLUSIONS: The consensus document highlights the importance of early diagnosis of AD. It recommends interpreting blood biomarkers in the patient's clinical context, not in isolation. Specialized units can start using them, but this should be accompanied by ongoing research. More data are needed for their use in general neurology and primary care. Their use is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals, population screenings, or as direct-to-consumer tests. Public health systems should facilitate their implementation through appropriate funding to ensure equitable access. This document should be understood as an initial framework subject to periodic updates as new data emerge.

BackgroundWhile cortical atrophy has been widely studied in dementia, emerging evidence highlights the role of subcortical degeneration, particularly in deep gray matter structures such as the thalamus, claustrum, and basal nuclei, in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, disease-specific subcortical patterns remain undercharacterized.ObjectiveTo quantify deep gray matter atrophy across the AD continuum (mild cognitive impairment and AD) and three FTD subtypes (bvFTD, svFTD, PNFA), and to assess longitudinal atrophy, cognitive associations, and diagnostic classification.MethodsWe applied a novel segmentation pipeline (sTHOMAS) to T1-weighted MRI data from 380 participants in the ADNI cohort and 274 participants in the FTLDNI cohort, with longitudinal follow-up available for 237 participants. Group differences were assessed using ANCOVA (adjusted for age and sex), followed by post hoc comparisons and effect size estimation (Cohen's d). Neuropsychological associations were examined using partial correlations. A hierarchical Random Forest model was trained to classify diagnostic groups.ResultsPronounced atrophy was observed in the mediodorsal, anteroventral, pulvinar thalamic nuclei, and nucleus accumbens, and claustrum in both AD and FTD, but was significantly greater in bvFTD. Longitudinal analysis revealed the fastest progression in bvFTD. Classification achieved 96.8% accuracy (AUC = 0.99) for AD versus FTD and 77.7% accuracy (AUC = 0.83) for PNFA versus svFTD. Subcortical atrophy correlated to executive, language, and semantic deficits.ConclusionsAtrophy in the mediodorsal, pulvinar, anteroventral thalamic nuclei, nucleus accumbens, and claustrum distinguishes AD from FTD and differentiates FTD subtypes. These subcortical structures represent promising biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND: People with Down syndrome (DS) have an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying factors associated with dementia onset and subsequent survival will support in understanding the disease profile, improving timely diagnosis, management, and care planning. METHOD: Variables associated with age at dementia onset and survival times were assessed in 279 adults with DS who accessed a community learning disability service. After outliers were removed, regression and hazard regression models were used for disease onset (n = 265) and survival times (n = 180), respectively. RESULTS: Earlier age at first assessment and living with family predicted earlier age at diagnosis, which led to longer survival, post-diagnosis. Epilepsy and living in a long-stay hospital were associated with earlier mortality. CONCLUSION: Implications for clinical practice include reflections on the importance of early baseline assessments and caregiver awareness. Suggestions for future research include investigating intersectionality of social factors with genetics to better understand AD trajectories.

Background: Hospitalization for severe neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents challenges, often requiring environments that ensure safety while addressing therapeutic needs. Traditional closed wards, originally designed for psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia, may not fully address the unique needs of AD patients. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a Specialized Dementia Ward (SDW) tailored for AD patients compared to a General Ward (GW). Methods: A retrospective study compared 51 AD patients in an SDW (February 2018-January 2019) and 40 AD patients in a GW (December 2017-January 2018). Patients met NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) ≤ 2 and a Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) ≤ 20. Clinical assessments at admission and four weeks included K-MMSE, Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set Version 2.0 (RAI-MDS), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). Psychotropic medication use, length of stay, and discharge destination were also analyzed. Results: No statistically significant differences emerged between SDW and GW groups regarding baseline demographics, cognitive function, ADL, or neuropsychiatric symptoms. At four weeks, both groups exhibited trends toward improved K-MMSE, RAI-MDS, and NPI-Q scores and reduced psychotropic usage, but these did not reach statistical significance. Although mean length of stay was shorter for SDW patients (3.2 vs. 4.9 months; p = 0.078), the difference was not significant. Notably, a significantly higher proportion of SDW patients were discharged home (58.8% vs. 37.5%; p = 0.049). Conclusions: Although clinical outcomes were comparable, the SDW demonstrated advantages in facilitating discharge to home, suggesting that tailored ward environments may better support AD patients. These findings underscore the importance of therapeutic environments in dementia care and highlight the need for further research on specialized dementia ward designs to improve outcomes and patient satisfaction.

Although recognized as one of the most critical and prevalent dementias, Alzheimer's disease (AD) still does not have an affirmative biological marker, being diagnosed by excluding other pathologies that present similar symptoms. In the last decade, advances have been made in researching pathophysiological phenomena related to AD, with the identification of probable biomarkers. Some of these substances have a direct action on the degenerative activity that involves AD and may be associated with other pathological processes, such as inflammation and diabetes. OBJECTIVE: These occurrences led us to investigate further whether the levels of certain substances may be associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Biomarkers can be found in plasma, saliva and cerebrospinal fluid. METHODS: This project investigated tau protein as a possible salivary biomarker in 76 patients, control group and Alzheimer's, with different age groups, to establish a positive correlation between the studied biomarker and AD. RESULTS: Our findings showed that phosphorylated tau (pTAU) concentrations are higher in AD patients and somewhat lower in elderly patients without Alzheimer's, but in young patients without Alzheimer's the levels are much lower. Total tau had very similar levels in three groups evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, we believe in the possibility of using saliva as an auxiliary method in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, with the advantages of low cost, non-invasiveness, and ease of collection. Still, more investigations will be needed to confirm this method presented.

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are complex and rapidly growing public health challenges that require integrative, collaborative approaches. To meet this need, the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) of South Carolina, a state-funded partnership across multiple institutions, has embraced a team science model that brings together expertise from four key disciplines: neuroimaging-neurology, health sciences, molecular biology, and engineering. This paper highlights the work at the University of South Carolina (USC) and how each discipline contributes uniquely yet collaboratively within a recurring loop model framework. Extending from USC's Cancer Prevention and Control Program, the framework guides scientific growth through four iterative phases: discovery, development, delivery, and dissemination. From identifying cellular and molecular biomarkers to applying neuroimaging for early diagnosis, utilizing wearable technologies for real-time monitoring, and analyzing statewide data to understand caregiver burden and health inequities, each group contributes to a comprehensive and translational research cycle. By supporting structured mentorship, cross-disciplinary pilot projects, and shared infrastructure, the ADRC initiatives advance research that is both scientifically rigorous and equity-focused. This approach provides a valuable framework for advancing ADRD research and can inform other institutions aiming to tackle similarly complex health issues from discovery through dissemination.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the relationship between postmortem neuropathological findings and in vivo imaging biomarkers is crucial for advancing the early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the association between postmortem neuropathologies and retrospective Tensor-Based Morphometry (TBM) findings across the Alzheimer's dementia continuum. METHODS: This study utilized tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to investigate structural brain changes associated with AD neuropathology. Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were analyzed, including MRI scans and neuropathological findings from 98 participants. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between TBM indices and neuropathological outcomes. The diagnostic performance of TBM was evaluated using accuracy analysis. RESULTS: Significant differences in TBM indices (StatROI and TempROI) were observed between the dementia and non-dementia groups. Logistic regression indicated that higher StatROI and TempROI indices were associated with lower odds of AD pathology, such as amyloid plaques (OR = 0.939 and 0.927), neurofibrillary tangles (OR = 0.961 and 0.931), and neuritic plaques (OR = 0.943 and 0.916). Accuracy analysis demonstrated good discriminatory power of TBM indices in differentiating pathologically confirmed AD from non-AD dementia (sensitivity up to 61.29, specificity up to 93.33%) and cognitively normal individual (sensitivity up to 82.26, specificity up to 75%). CONCLUSION: TBM is a promising tool for predicting the underlying neuropathology of AD and distinguishing between different causes of dementia. Integrating TBM into clinical assessments can enhance the accuracy of AD diagnosis and improve patient management.

BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of evidence on the association between genetic propensity for hippocampal atrophy with cognitive outcomes. Therefore, we examined the relationship of the polygenic risk score for hippocampal atrophy (PRShp) with the incidence of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as the rates of cognitive decline. METHODS: Participants were drawn from the population-based HELIAD cohort. Comprehensive neuropsychological assessments were performed at baseline and at follow-up. PRShp was derived from the summary statistics of a large genome-wide association study for hippocampal volume. Cox proportional hazards models as well as generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to evaluate the association of PRShp with the combined incidence of aMCI/AD and cognitive changes over time, respectively. All models were adjusted for age, sex, education, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. RESULTS: Our analysis included 618 older adults, among whom 73 developed aMCI/AD after an average follow-up of 2.96 ± 0.8 years. Each additional SD of PRShp elevated the relative hazard for incident aMCI/AD by 46%. Participants at the top quartile of PRShp had an almost three times higher risk of converting to aMCI/AD compared to the lowest quartile group. Higher PRShp scores were also linked to steeper global cognitive and memory decline. The impact of PRShp was greater among women and younger adults. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the association of PRShp with aMCI/AD incidence and with global cognitive and memory decline over time. The PRS association was sex- and age-dependent, suggesting that these factors should be considered in genetic modelling for AD.

INTRODUCTION: Multimorbidity is associated with increased risk of dementia, but previous estimation of the joint contribution of constituent conditions to dementia incidence did not model additive contributions or temporal proximity in the sequential onset of conditions. METHODS: Data were analyzed from 9944 Health and Retirement Study participants and Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, ages 68-99, without Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) at baseline, from 1998-2016. ADRD and chronic condition were encoded using validated claims algorithms. We estimated the absolute contribution of eight conditions to ADRD with the longitudinal extension of the average attributable fraction (LE-AAF). RESULTS: Hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and arthritis additively accounted for 71.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 62.9%-79.1%) of ADRD incident cases based on LE-AAF. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that multimorbidity plays a pivotal role in ADRD incidence. Targeting constituents of a cardiovascular path to dementia may contribute most to lowering dementia risk. HIGHLIGHTS: Most dementia cases (71.8%) were attributable to eight chronic conditions. Hypertension was the largest contributor to dementia risk. Confidence intervals were smallest for constituents of a cardiovascular path to dementia. Longitudinal extension of the average attributable fractions (LE-AAFs) explicitly consider longitudinal patterns of comorbidities. Acute myocardial infarction did not contribute significantly to dementia incidence.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this study was to conduct a review of the literature published over the past 18 months and present the latest findings on hydration in individuals with dementia. RECENT FINDINGS: A systematic review identified sarcopenia, polypharmacy, delayed oral transit, and poor rinsing ability as markers of eating-drinking-swallowing difficulties in early-stage dementia. A cross-sectional study found a high prevalence of dehydration (57-68%) among dementia patients, associated with hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, dysphagia, and cognitive decline. An analysis of national dementia care guidelines showed that only the UK and Switzerland addressed assisted nutrition and hydration. "Jelly Drops," a hydrating product for dementia patients, received innovation awards. A study on US Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment forms highlighted inconsistent terminology for end-of-life nutrition and hydration, calling for clearer language to aid decision-making. SUMMARY: The new hydration-related recommendations in the ESPEN 2024 guidelines for dementia reflect a more individualized, proactive, and comprehensive approach to managing hydration. These guidelines emphasize the importance of early detection, personalized interventions, and consistent monitoring to ensure that dehydration is identified and treated promptly. Furthermore, the current literature supports the need for a specific terminology for dementia management using nutrition and hydration to improve patients' health outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between depression and the risk of dementia. DESIGN: A real-world longitudinal study. SETTING: This comprehensive study involved elderly adults in Yichang, China, who were dementia-free at baseline from 2016 to 2023. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were followed until the onset of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and unspecified dementia until December 31, 2023. EXPOSURE: Depression was identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes, based on linked electronic health records. MEASURES: Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from the Cox proportional hazards regression models to evaluate the risks of all-cause dementia and its subtypes associated with prevalent depression. RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 3.63 years, we observed a total of 1 493 individuals developing dementia among 4 341 depressed and 43 214 matched non-depressed individuals (62.4% female; mean [SD] age at baseline 64.4 [11.1] years). Notably, a stronger association was observed between depression and the onset of Alzheimer's disease (adjusted HR, 4.96; 95% CI, 2.95-8.34) compared to vascular dementia (adjusted HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.18-3.11). Moreover, our study intriguingly revealed a U-shaped association between the risk of Alzheimer's disease and the duration of time an individual has been diagnosed with depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings unveil a significant association between depression and all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. The unique temporal association suggests that depression may serve as both a risk factor and a prodromal symptom for Alzheimer's disease, and solely as a risk factor for vascular dementia.

BACKGROUND: Midlife women play a major role as the family caregivers of persons living with Alzheimer's disease (PLAD). Cultural differences are frequently the major reason for the high risk faced by racial and ethnic minority family caregivers. However, little is known about the characteristics of midlife women family caregivers that are linked to their negative attitudes toward Alzheimer's disease and dementia care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the characteristics of midlife women who were family caregivers of PLAD that were linked to their negative attitudes toward Alzheimer's disease and dementia caregiving. METHODS: A secondary data analysis was conducted using data from 172 midlife women who were family caregivers of PLAD and participated in a large cross-sectional online survey. Linear multiple regression analyses were used for the data analysis. RESULTS: Participants' attitude toward Alzheimer's disease and related dementia scores were significantly associated with employment status, race/ethnicity (Hispanic), and instrumental activities of daily living. Those who were unemployed, Hispanic, and with low instrumental activities of daily living tended to have negative attitudes toward Alzheimer's disease and dementia care. CONCLUSIONS: Additional interventions should be developed to improve attitudes toward caring for persons with Alzheimer's disease and dementia in this specific group of midlife women who are family caregivers of PLAD.

BACKGROUND: Pain is highly prevalent but challenging to assess in individuals with dementia. Non-cognitive symptoms, such as behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and undetected pain, can severely impair functionality and degrade the quality of life for Alzheimer's disease patients. This study aims to examine the relationship between pain and BPSD in patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: A hospital-based, cross-sectional study using a convenience sampling technique was conducted with Alzheimer's disease patients attending an outpatient clinic at a tertiary care geriatric centre. Participants' cognitive impairment was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), pain severity was evaluated with the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAIN-AD) scale, and BPSD was measured using the Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD). Over 6 months, 50 participants who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. RESULTS: The median age of the participants was 69 years, with a median MMSE score of 16. All participants experienced some level of pain and exhibited at least one BPSD. Statistical analysis revealed a significant association between both subjective and objective pain and behavioural and psychological symptoms. A strong correlation was also observed between NRS and PAIN-AD scores with affective disturbances and anxieties. CONCLUSION: Common occurrence of pain and BPSD in Alzheimer's disease among the Indian population underscores the importance of pain assessment and management for enhancing patient well-being.

Emerging evidence supports the central role of the immune system in brain health, yet little is known about the role of circulating immune cells and cognitive function or brain health in dementia-free populations. We investigated the association of 43 immune cells with cognitive function, structural brain imaging, and incident dementia in Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants. Immune cells were phenotyped by flow cytometry. Linear mixed effects models were used for cross-sectional associations between immune cells and 4 cognitive domain scores and 13 brain magnetic resonance imaging measurements. Cox proportional hazards regression models tested the relationship between immune cells and time to dementia. Models were adjusted for age, sex, education, cytomegalovirus status, and APOE genotype, with further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. Data was further stratified by cytomegalovirus status. Among 795 participants with cellular phenotyping, cognitive testing and brain imaging data (mean age 61, 52% women), there were no associations between immune cells and cognitive test scores. Several significant associations between immune cells and regional brain magnetic resonance imaging measurements were observed. Higher CD8+ cells [CD8+CD45RO-CCR7-CD27- (Teff), CD8+CD45RA+CD28-CD57+(TEMRA), CD8+CD27-CD28-] associated with greater cerebrum gray and frontal gray matter volumes and inclusion of cardiovascular risk factors strengthened the association. Among CMV+ participants, CD8+TEMRA and CD8+Teff cells were significantly associated with higher total gray and frontal gray matter volumes. No significant associations were observed between immune cells and incident all-cause or Alzheimer's disease dementia. The pathobiology underpinning the associations between immune cells and brain volumes require further study and validation in diverse samples.

OBJECTIVE: This study examines how social and healthcare structures in Ireland shape the experiences of individuals diagnosed with Lewy body dementia (LBD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with particular attention to diagnostic pathways, care access, and social constructions of dementia. METHODS: Twenty-three participants with mild to moderate dementia resulting from LBD (n = 12) and AD (n = 11) participated in in-depth interviews between September 2022 and February 2023. Using a descriptive phenomenological approach informed by social constructivist perspectives, interviews were analysed to understand how institutional, geographical, and social factors influence experiences of diagnosis, post-diagnostic support, and public awareness. RESULTS: Healthcare structures and social understanding of dementia created divergent experiences for individuals with LBD and AD. While AD participants generally encountered established diagnostic pathways aligned with dominant cultural understanding of dementia as memory loss, LBD participants faced structural barriers due to complex symptomatology and limited specialist knowledge. Geographic inequalities in accessing specialised diagnostic services particularly affected rural LBD participants. Post-diagnosis, LBD participants encountered greater institutional barriers in accessing appropriate support, reflecting systemic gaps in service provision. Both groups highlighted how societal misconceptions about dementia shaped their lived experiences, with LBD participants particularly affected by the cultural dominance of the Alzheimer's narrative. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates how social structures, healthcare systems, and cultural understandings of dementia create inequitable experiences for individuals with different forms of dementia in Ireland. Findings highlight the need for structural changes in healthcare delivery, increased professional education about LBD, and broader societal awareness to address these disparities.

Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) pose major global healthcare challenges, with diabetes mellitus (DM) being a key risk factor. Both AD and DM-related ADRD are characterized by reduced cerebral blood flow, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. We previously identified compromised cerebral hemodynamics as early signs in TgF344-AD and type 2 DM-ADRD (T2DN) rat models. Genome-wide studies have linked AD/ADRD to SNPs in soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). This study explored the effects of sEH inhibition with TPPU on cerebral vascular function and cognition in AD and DM-ADRD models. Chronic TPPU treatment improved cognition in both AD and DM-ADRD rats without affecting body weight. In DM-ADRD rats, TPPU reduced plasma glucose and HbA1c levels. Transcriptomic analysis of primary cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells from AD rats treated with TPPU revealed enhanced pathways related to cell contraction, alongside decreased oxidative stress and inflammation. Both AD and DM-ADRD rats exhibited impaired myogenic responses and autoregulation in the cerebral circulation, which were normalized with chronic sEH inhibition. Additionally, TPPU improved acetylcholine-induced vasodilation in the middle cerebral arteries (MCA) of DM-ADRD rats. Acute TPPU administration unexpectedly caused vasoconstriction in the MCA of DM-ADRD rats at lower doses. In contrast, higher doses or longer durations were required to induce effective vasodilation at physiological perfusion pressure in both control and ADRD rats. Additionally, TPPU decreased reactive oxygen species production in cerebral vessels of AD and DM-ADRD rats. These findings provide novel evidence that chronic sEH inhibition can reverse cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairments in AD/ADRD, offering a promising avenue for therapeutic development.

INTRODUCTION: Dreaming is subserved by the default mode network (DMN) and can be abolished by focal lesions within key regions. DMN dysfunction is promoted by pre-clinical Alzheimer's pathology and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriage, but any effects of these on dreaming are unknown. METHODS: Associations between dream recall and APOE ε4 carriage and blood phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 217 levels were determined using data for 1049 cognitively normal adults. Associations between dream recall and cognitive decline and dementia risk were also investigated. RESULTS: Higher p-tau217 levels and APOE ε4 carriage were both associated with lower chances of dream recall, independently of memory test scores and other covariates. Not recalling dreams at baseline was associated with faster cognitive decline and greater likelihood of dementia over 10 years of follow up. DISCUSSION: Poor dream recall in later life may be a novel and easily assessed indicator of early neurodegeneration.

Biological definitions of neurological diseases are now becoming a reality, although still in the research phase. This development will recategorize neurological diseases, providing objective diagnostics and the promise of therapeutics that target biological mechanisms - similar to the strategy that has proven successful in tumours and other conditions. In this Perspective article, we discuss this development for dementias with dominant Lewy pathology, as the availability of biological assays for this pathology has sparked new interest in a single disease diagnosis for all individuals positive for α-synuclein. On the basis of current evidence, we argue that an α-synuclein assay alone is unlikely to be a specific criterion for a spectrum of clinical syndromes with Lewy pathology or a definitive diagnostic marker for Lewy body dementia. We advocate that one biological assay will not reflect the complex spatiotemporal features of brain pathology. Diverse sequential mechanisms underpin the highly heterogeneous phenotypes and clinicopathological processes of Lewy body dementias. Disease modification, if possible, will be most effective when it targets the early underlying mechanisms, especially those leading to aggressive phenotypes.

A growing body of literature has examined the impact of neighborhood characteristics on Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, yet the spatial variability and relative importance of the most influential factors remain underexplored. We compiled various widely recognized factors to examine spatial heterogeneity and associations with AD dementia prevalence via geographically weighted random forest (GWRF) approach. The GWRF outperformed conventional models with an out-of-bag R(2) of 74.8% in predicting AD dementia prevalence and the lowest error (MAE = 0.34, RMSE = 0.45). Key findings showed that mobile homes were the most influential factor in 19.9% of U.S. counties, followed by NDVI (17.4%), physical inactivity (12.9%), households with no vehicle (11.3%), and particulate matter (10.4%), while other primary factors affecting <10% of U.S. counties. Findings highlight the need for county-specific interventions tailored to local risk factors. Policies should prioritize increasing affordable housing stability, expanding green spaces, improving transportation access, promoting physical activity, and reducing air pollution exposure.

Vascular dementia (VaD) is a second most common type of dementia subsequent to Alzheimer disease (AD). VaD is characterized by cognitive impairment and memory loss that may progress due to the development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) a hallmark of AD. CAA triggers the progression of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes with the subsequent the development of VaD and mixed dementia. Early diagnosis of patients with appropriate use of anti-inflammatory can prevent CAA-related inflammation and VaD development. Currently, there are no effective drugs in the management of VaD. Of note, cholesterol-lowering agent statins which are commonly used in patients with vascular diseases and dyslipidemia may affect the progression of VaD. Many previous studies highlighted the potential therapeutic efficacy of statins in treating VaD. Though, the underlying mechanisms of statins in prevention and treatment of VaD are not fully clarified. Consequently, this review aims to discuss the mechanistic role of statins in the management of VaD, and how statins may adversely affect the cognitive function in VaD patients.

We investigated associations between apolipoprotein E (APOE) alleles and motor manifestations in Alzheimer's dementia (AD) capitalizing on National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center data: the baseline evaluations of older adults (≥60 years) with a diagnosis of AD were analyzed. Those with a concomitant diagnosis Parkinson's disease or other parkinsonian syndrome, and those treated with anti-parkinsonian agents were excluded. Three APOE groups were formed: APOE2 (APOE2 carriers), APOE3 (APOE3/APOE3) and APOE4 (APOE4/APOE4, APOE4/APOE3). UPDRS-III was used to assess the presence or absence of motor signs in 9 domains. Adjusted binary logistic models featuring the three APOE groups as exposures and motor domains as outcomes were estimated. There were 389 individuals in the APOE2, 1799 in the APOE3 and 2791 in the APOE4 groups. Compared to the APOE2 group, individuals in the APOE4 group had lower odds of having at least one motor sign [0.64 (0.50-0.82)]. Among motor signs, rigidity [0.53 (0.34-0.81)], bradykinesia [0.56 (0.40-0.77)], impaired chair rise [0.54 (0.37-0.78)] and impaired posture-gait [0.54 (0.36, 0.81)] exhibited significant associations. Exploratory analyses featuring APOE genotypes suggested dose-response relationships for both APOE2 and APOE4. In conclusion, APOE2 confers a risk towards motor (mainly parkinsonian) signs in AD. APOE4 may have a protective effect.

INTRODUCTION: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) encompasses a group of heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders. Aside from genetic cases, its diagnosis is challenging, particularly in the early stages when symptoms are ambiguous, and structural neuroimaging does not reveal characteristic patterns. AREAS COVERED: The authors performed a comprehensive literature search through MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases to gather evidence to aid the diagnostic process for suspected FTD patients, particularly in early phases, even in sporadic cases, ranging from established to promising tools. Blood-based biomarkers might help identify very early neuropathological stages and guide further evaluations. Subsequently, neurophysiological measures reflecting functional changes in cortical excitatory/inhibitory circuits, along with functional neuroimaging assessing brain network, connectivity, metabolism, and perfusion alterations, could detect specific changes associated to FTD even decades before symptom onset. As the neuropathological process advances, cognitive-behavioral profiles and atrophy patterns emerge, distinguishing specific FTD subtypes. EXPERT OPINION: Emerging disease-modifying therapies require early patient enrollment. Therefore, a diagnostic paradigm shift is needed - from relying on typical cognitive and neuroimaging profiles of advanced cases to widely applicable biomarkers, primarily fluid biomarkers, and, subsequently, neurophysiological and functional neuroimaging biomarkers where appropriate. Additionally, exploring subjective complaints and behavioral changes detected by home-based technologies might be crucial for early diagnosis.

The population of family caregivers (FCGs) of persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is growing, as is the proportion of males taking on this traditionally female role. Caregiving research has centered around women due to historic roles, resulting in a knowledge gap regarding male caregiving experiences. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to explore the experiences of male FCGs of people with ADRD. Eleven male caregivers were recruited and interviewed by telephone or Zoom/videoconferencing. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Four major themes emerged highlighting males' struggles with the unfamiliar caregiving role and changing identity; their acknowledgment of personal growth and discovery through caregiving; their challenges in finding the "right" kind of support; and their perceived reshaping of masculinity through the caregiving role. Male caregivers expressed unique experiences as FCGs. Findings indicate the need for researchers and clinicians to develop tailored support to address their needs.

Improving caregivers' quality of life begins with conducting research that aims to understand caregiver's needs. However, caregivers may be reluctant to participate in research studies, adding to the importance of developing, tracking, and evaluating recruitment strategies. Here, we review the nationwide community outreach practices we implemented as our lab embarked on a program of research to develop an online intervention tailored for those caring for a spouse with Alzheimer's Disease or a Related Dementia (ADRD). We made hundreds of "cold" calls and e-mails to organizations across the US who may have access to caregivers, but whom we had no prior relationship with. It took 36.5 contact attempts to possible recruitment sites for every 1 enrolled caregiver. While time consuming, this low-cost recruitment method may offer a route for research teams to recruit caregivers into research studies without access to a medical center or collaborating physician(s).

Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses significant challenges for the elderly, leading to cognitive decline, social isolation, and lower quality of life. Current interventions often require cumbersome wearable devices e.g. the camera-based monitoring that may raise privacy concerns. However, these issues are not fully addressed previously. To fill this gap, this research proposes a new framework in non-invasive combination of Virtual Reality (VR), Voice recognition, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to act as a supportive system for people with AD. The system provides a brand-new approach that tailored cognitive stimulation and companionship through the immersive VR scenarios, memory games, virtual trips, and an AI assistant together as a single platform. The AI-based assessment of the patient is employed to ensure that the experience is more relevant and helpful to the patient. The voice recognition is the most simple and easy user-interface. The security measures include access controls, encryption and continuous monitoring of cloud patient data. The initial study has been promising evidenced by the outcome of involving patients with Alzheimer's and dementia, their families, and clinicians. Participants reported heightened interest, better quality of life, less sense of isolation, and improved cognitive functioning, which have particularly achieved one of our goals, in patients' well-beings in mental healthcare. The research indicates a significant step forward enhancing the quality of support for both cognitive function and social interaction for older adults with AD and dementia. In comparison with other currently existing systems, our newly developed integrated framework has made additional contributions to the areas of AD in dynamic cognitive adaptation, bilingual interaction, and secure real-time personalized system.

Dementia is defined by significant chronic or acquired impairment in a single domain or loss of two or more cognitive functions by brain disease or injury. It is a common chronic syndrome in adults and constitutes the fifth leading cause of death in patients >65 years of age. Multiple etiologies of dementia exist, most notably Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies, as well as other neurologic diseases such as vascular dementia and normal pressure hydrocephalus. In addition to aiding clinicians in selecting the most appropriate imaging test for patients suspected of one of these dementia syndromes, this document highlights the most appropriate initial imaging tests for patients with suspected mild cognitive impairment and rapidly progressive dementia, as well as the most appropriate pre- and posttreatment imaging tests for patients undergoing therapy with antiamyloid monoclonal antibodies. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

The definition of dementia has been updated in the DSM-V criteria. It is actually no longer termed Dementia but is now called Major Neurocognitive Disorder (MND). However, due to the common use of the term dementia in society and medical literature, it will be referred to as both Dementia and Major Neurocognitive Disorder in this article. It is worth noting the limitations of using the term dementia, including its common association exclusively with the elderly, and that it is often used synonymously with Alzheimer's disease. Major neurocognitive disorder can affect younger individuals and does not always imply Alzheimer's disease as the etiology of cognitive decline. Major neurocognitive disorder is characterized by a significant decline in at least one of the domains of cognition which include executive function, complex attention, language, learning and memory, perceptual-motor, or social cognition. The decline represents a change from a patient's prior level of cognitive ability, is persistent and progressive over time, and not associated exclusively with an episode of delirium. In addition to the cognitive decline, there must also be a decline in the patient's ability to function and perform everyday tasks. The everyday function of a patient is often evaluated in terms of the ability to perform IADL's (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) such as managing finances or medications, or if more severe, ADL's (Activities of Daily Living) such as grooming or feeding oneself. It is often a progressive disorder, and individuals often do not have insight into their deficits. Currently, no cure exists for any of the causes of dementia. The prevalence of dementia is expected to continue to increase along with the increasing numbers of the aging population. Currently, 47 million people in the world have dementia, and the number is expected to increase to 131 million by 2050. Alzheimer's disease is the 5th leading cause of death for people over the age of 65 in the United States. Dementia is a significant public health burden and significantly increases the costs of care, both to the individual and society. The individual lifetime cost to care for an individual with dementia was nearly $200,000 more than an individual without dementia. In 2010, the costs of treating dementia in the United States were projected to be about $200 billion per year in the United States and $600 billion worldwide.

INTRODUCTION: Dysphagia affects a significant number of patients with Alzheimer's dementia. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation may be a promising resource for dysphagia rehabilitation in this population. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the immediate effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on hyoid bone displacement, pharyngeal transit time, and swallowing safety in elderly people with Alzheimer's dementia. METHODS: We evaluated 30 elderly individuals with an average age of 82.79 years, regardless of the stage of dementia and with reduced hyolaryngeal elevation, using the Northwestern Dysphagia Patient Check Sheet. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation was performed at the sensory and motor levels in the submental region during videofluoroscopy, with food being offered in solid, pudding, and liquid consistencies, and in portions of 5 mL and 10 mL. We applied Analysis of variance and the Friedman test, adopting a significance level of < 5%. RESULTS: The comparison between the sensory and motor levels of stimulation showed that there was a significant difference in hyoid bone displacement for the mushy consistency, with neuromuscular stimulation at the motor level. There was no difference in the application of stimuli for the other consistencies regarding hyoid bone displacement, pharyngeal transit time, and the penetration and aspiration scale. CONCLUSION: In elderly people with Alzheimer's dementia, neuromuscular electrical stimulation at the motor level generated a reduction in hyoid bone displacement during swallowing of food with pudding consistency, with no effects on pharyngeal transit time or swallowing safety.

INTRODUCTION: Recent developments in the field of social cognition have led to a renewed interest in basic and social emotion recognition in early stages of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and FrontoTemporal Dementia (FTD). Despite the growing attention to this issue, only few studies have attempted to investigate emotion recognition using both visual and vocal stimuli. In addition, recent studies have presented conflicting findings regarding the extent of impairment in patients in the early stages of these diseases. The present study aims to investigate emotion understanding (both basic and social emotions), using different tasks with visual and auditory stimuli, to identify supramodal deficits in AD and FTD to provide a reliable tool to better outline their behavioral and emotional profile and useful instruments for their management. METHODS: Eighteen patients with AD and 15 patients with FTD were included in the study. Healthy control (HCs) subjects were recruited to obtain normative data for basic emotion recognition tests and social emotion recognition tasks. To evaluate basic emotion recognition, the Facial Emotion Recognition Battery (FERB) and the Emotional Prosody Recognition Battery (EPRB) were administered. To evaluate social emotion recognition, the Faux Pas (FP), Reading the Mind in the Eyes (RME), and Reading the Mind in the Voice (RMV) tests were employed. RESULTS: FTD patients performed significantly worse than HCs in most of the subtests of the basic emotion recognition batteries, where, instead, AD patients were significantly impaired only when required to match emotional facial expression in different individuals (subtask of the FERB). Moreover, FTD patients scored significantly lower in RME and RMV tests compared both to AD patients and to HCs. In addition, ADs were selectively impaired in RMV as respect to HCs. DISCUSSION: FTD patients showed deficits in emotion recognition, affecting both basic and social emotions, whether conveyed through facial expressions or prosody. This result may explain the well-known social behavioral difficulties observed in FTD patients from the early stages of the disease. The fewer and specific deficits in AD patients with comparable MMSE scores may be attributed to the mild degree of impairment, as these deficits may appear later in the progression of AD.

Although the human cerebellum is known to be neuropathologically impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD), the cell type-specific transcriptional and epigenomic changes that contribute to this pathology are not well understood. Here, we report single-nucleus multiome (snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq) analysis of 103,861 nuclei isolated from both cerebellum and frontal cortex of AD/ADRD patients and normal controls. Using peak-to-gene linkage analysis, we identified 431,834 significant linkages between gene expression and cell subtype-specific chromatin accessibility regions enriched for candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs). These cCREs were associated with AD/ADRD-specific transcriptomic changes and disease-related gene regulatory networks, especially for RAR Related Orphan Receptor A (RORA) and E74 Like ETS Transcription Factor 1 (ELF1) in cerebellar Purkinje cells and granule cells, respectively. Trajectory analysis of granule cell populations further identified disease-relevant transcription factors, such as RORA, and their regulatory targets. Finally, we pinpointed two likely causal genes, Seizure Related 6 Homolog Like 2 (SEZ6L2) in Purkinje cells and KAT8 Regulatory NSL Complex Subunit 1 (KANSL1) in granule cells, through integrative analysis of cCREs derived from snATAC-seq, genome-wide AD/ADRD loci, and three-dimensional (3D) genome data. Via CRISPRi experiments, we found that perturbation of rs4788201 and rs62056801 significantly inhibited the expression of their target genes, SEZ6L2 and KANSL1, in human iPSC-derived neurons. This cell subtype-specific regulatory landscape in the human cerebellum identified here offers novel genomic and epigenomic insights into the neuropathology and pathobiology of AD/ADRD and other neurological disorders if broadly applied.

BACKGROUND: In the absence of a cerebrovascular accident, whether asymptomatic extracranial carotid atherosclerotic disease (aECAD) affects Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD dementia risk is not clear. Understanding whether aECAD is associated with an increased risk for AD is important as it is present in roughly 10% of the population over 60 and could represent a modifiable risk factor for AD and non-AD dementia. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analysed Mariner insurance claims. Enrolment criteria included patients aged 55 years or older with at least 5 years of data and no initial dementia diagnosis. Subjects with and without aECAD were evaluated for subsequent AD and non-AD dementia diagnoses. Propensity score matching was performed using confounding factors identified by logistic regression. χ(2) tests and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to evaluate the impact of aECAD diagnosis on AD and non-AD dementia risk over time. RESULTS: 767 354 patients met enrolment criteria. After propensity score matching, 62 963 subjects with aECAD and 62 963 subjects without ECAD were followed through data records. The aECAD cohort exhibited an increased relative risk of 1.22 (95% CI 1.15 to 1.29, p<0.001) for AD and 1.48 (95% CI 1.38 to 1.59, p<0.001) for non-AD dementias compared with the propensity score-matched cohort without aECAD. The increased AD risk associated with aECAD was evident in patients younger than 75 years old and was less apparent in patients over 75 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: aECAD is associated with an increased risk of developing AD and non-AD dementias. These findings underscore the need for further prospective evaluation of interactions between aECAD and dementia, with potential implications for change of clinical care in both of these large patient populations.

The present review describes the use and effectiveness of mental imagery in Alzheimer's disease-related dementia. Six databases were thoroughly searched from January 2010 to December 2024. Different types of studies were retrieved and reviewed for imagery of the motor, cognitive, and emotional states and quality of life of the elderly with dementia. Although the scarce results showed the positive effect of mental imagery to the every-day life of older adults with dementia, more research should be conducted with larger homogenous samples and more valid tools. Future recommendations are provided.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD) are the two most common forms of dementia, and they share common mechanisms, especially in regard to neurovascular dysfunction. There has been increasing evidence that the disruption of the neurovascular unit (NVU), which consists of endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, microglia, neurons, and basement membrane, is one of the key early events in both AD and VD. The objective of this review is to summarize the structure and physiological function of the NVU, then discuss the pathological remodeling of the NVU in AD and VD and finally, show emerging evidence of multi-target approaches that restore the NVU and neurovascular protection. We begin with a description of the structure, and dietary regulatory roles of the NVU in cerebral homeostasis, especially related to Aβ, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and neurovascular coupling (NVC). The NVU is then related to the pathological events that cause AD and VD, specifically to impaired Aβ clearance, inflammatory cascades, oxidative stress, and neurovascular uncoupling. Finally, the discussion focuses on a multi-target approach involving exercise, estrogen therapy, mesenchymal stem cells/exosomes, remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), and mindfulness meditation, and analyzes its implications for recovering NVU structure and function. We also discuss the concept of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) approaches associated with NVU modulation with herbal formulas, traditional Chinese exercises and acupuncture, which has integrative pathways for MVU modulation. NVU dysfunction has a significant and converging impact on the development of both AD and VD. There is considerable support for multi-pathway neurovascular unit targeting, which should show a significant delay in cognitive decline. Incorporating multi-modal evidence from contemporary and traditional medical systems could offer new insights for individualized, neurovascular-targeted therapy for dementia.

Biological, clinicobiological and clinical conceptions of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are being promoted simultaneously to different practical ends. The co-existence of contemporary conceptions and the 'scary label' associated with older diagnostic criteria create the possibility of misunderstanding and harm. In this comment, we argue in favour of socio-ethical interventions targeted to health workers and the general public so as to lower the uncertainties introduced by contemporary diagnostic criteria and to articulate how they relate to established criteria.

Pharmacological interventions for dementia include medications aimed at alleviating its core symptom: cognitive dysfunction. These medicines are known as anti-dementia drugs. As our understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has advanced, the amyloid hypothesis stating that amyloid proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of AD has been proposed. To date, anti-dementia drugs such as cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists have focused on symptomatic treatment. In recent years, based on the amyloid hypothesis, the development of medicines that target either (1) the enzyme that produces amyloid beta (Aβ) or (2) Aβ itself, has been promoted as a treatment strategy for AD. In 2021, the first drug targeting Aβ, aducanumab, was launched in the USA. In Japan, lecanemab and donanemab are now available as monoclonal antibodies targeting Aβ. Additionally, medications have been used to manage the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), Parkinsonism, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. Furthermore, dementia is a major risk factor for delirium, which often occurs during the course of dementia. In this study, we introduce pharmacotherapy with anti-dementia drugs, BPSD treatment, and delirium.

OBJECTIVE: Cortical regions such as parietal area H (PH) and the fundus of the superior temporal sulcus (FST) are involved in higher visual function and may play a role in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), which is frequently associated with hallucinations. The authors evaluated functional connectivity between these two regions for distinguishing participants with DLB from those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from cognitively normal (CN) individuals to identify a functional connectivity MRI signature for DLB. METHODS: Eighteen DLB participants completed cognitive testing and functional MRI scans and were matched to AD or MCI and CN individuals whose data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (https://adni.loni.usc.edu). Images were analyzed with data from Human Connectome Project (HCP) comparison individuals by using a machine learning-based subject-specific HCP atlas based on diffusion tractography. RESULTS: Bihemispheric functional connectivity of the PH to left FST regions was reduced in the DLB group compared with the AD and CN groups (mean±SD connectivity score=0.307±0.009 vs. 0.456±0.006 and 0.433±0.006, respectively). No significant differences were detected among the groups in connectivity within basal ganglia structures, and no significant correlations were observed between neuropsychological testing results and functional connectivity between the PH and FST regions. Performances on clock-drawing and number-cancelation tests were significantly and negatively correlated with connectivity between the right caudate nucleus and right substantia nigra for DLB participants but not for AD or CN participants. CONCLUSIONS: The functional connectivity between PH and FST regions is uniquely affected by DLB and may help distinguish this condition from AD.

BackgroundThere are limited studies quantifying the extent to which neighborhood deprivation affects mortality in individuals living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD).ObjectiveTo quantify to what extent neighborhood deprivation affects adverse outcomes in individuals living with AD/ADRD.MethodsWe identified individuals with AD/ADRD using a 15% random sample of national Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. Area deprivation index (ADI) was spatially linked to the Medicare AD/ADRD cohort using zip codes. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to examine the association between ADI and all-cause mortality among beneficiaries with AD/ADRD.ResultsAfter adjusting for patients characteristics, compared to the lowest ADI quartile (Q1), higher ADI quartiles were associated with higher odds of all-cause mortality in individuals with AD/ADRD (Q2 = OR 1.08 [95% CI: 1.06, 1.10], Q3 = OR 1.09 [95% CI: 1.07, 1.11], and Q4 OR 1.05 [95% CI: 1.03, 1.07]).ConclusionsNeighborhood deprivation is an independent risk factor for mortality in persons with AD/ADRD.

BACKGROUND: Growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) is a key protein involved in neuronal growth and synaptic plasticity. Alterations in GAP-43 levels have been associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), potentially reflecting synaptic dysfunction. We evaluated the potential of GAP-43 as a biomarker for AD and explored its association with amyloid-beta (Aβ) levels, as well as its correlation with Aβ plaque burden in the brain. METHODS: We screened 1,639 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. A total of 226 individuals met the eligibility criteria and were enrolled. Participants were classified into three groups: 77 cognitively normal (CN) individuals, 111 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 38 with a diagnosis of AD. The associations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GAP-43 levels with other biomarkers as well as [¹⁸F] AV-45 (Florbetapir) PET Standardized Uptake Value Ratios (SUVR) were investigated. RESULTS: Our findings revealed significantly elevated CSF GAP-43 levels in individuals with AD compared to CN and MCI groups. Furthermore, GAP-43 levels showed a significant positive correlation with tau pathology. Notably, we observed a significant association between GAP-43 and [¹⁸F] Florbetapir PET SUVR in the MCI group, suggesting that GAP-43 may serve as a reliable biomarker in the early stages of AD. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence supporting the role of GAP-43 as a potential biomarker for AD, particularly in relation to predicting the amyloid pathology pattern in the brain in the MCI stage.

Multimorbidity-the co-occurrence of two or more chronic health conditions-affects > 86% of people with dementia. It is associated with cognitive and functional decline, reduced health-related quality of life, increased health-care use, and higher mortality. The relationship between multimorbidity and dementia is potentially bidirectional; conditions such as hypertension and diabetes increase the risk of developing dementia, and cognitive impairment can complicate their management. This complexity presents challenges in health care and research, affecting treatment decisions and often leading to the exclusion of these individuals from clinical trials. Understanding multimorbidity through long-term prospective studies is crucial to clarify its relationship with dementia. Investigating specific disease combinations, environmental and genetic factors, and their impacts on cognitive health will guide the development of effective prediction models and inclusive intervention strategies for diverse global populations across the life course. HIGHLIGHTS: Multimorbidity affects > 86% of individuals with dementia, worsening outcomes. The relationship between multimorbidity and dementia is potentially bidirectional. Chronic conditions hinder dementia management and clinical trial inclusion. Life-course multimorbidity research is key to dementia risk reduction strategies. Prospective studies are needed to improve prediction models and interventions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) typically do not exhibit distinct differences in clinical manifestations and auxiliary examination results, which leads to a high misdiagnosis rate. However, significant differences in treatment approaches and prognosis between these two diseases underscore the critical need for an accurate diagnosis of AD and VaD. In this study, serum samples from 33 patients with AD patients, 37 patients with VaD, and 130 healthy individuals were collected, employing near-infrared aquaphotomics technology in combination with deep learning for differential diagnoses. Through an analysis of water absorption patterns among different diseases via aquaphotomics, the efficacies of traditional machine learning methods (Support Vector Machine and Decision Trees) and deep learning approaches (Deep Forest) in modeling were compared. Ultimately, by leveraging feature extraction techniques in conjunction with deep learning, a differential diagnostic model for AD and VaD was successfully developed. The results revealed that aquaphotomics could identify a certain correlation between the number of hydrogen bonds in water molecules and the development of AD and VaD; the deep learning model was found to be superior to traditional machine learning models, achieving an accuracy of 98.67 %, sensitivity of 97.33 %, and specificity of 100.00 %. The bands identified using the Competitive Adaptive Reweighting Algorithm method, primarily located at approximately 1300-1500 nm, showed a significant correlation with water molecules containing four hydrogen bonds. These results highlighted the potential role of the water molecule hydrogen-bond network in disease development and were consistent with the aquaphotomics analysis results. Therefore, the differential diagnostic model developed by integrating near-infrared spectroscopy and deep learning was proven to be effective and feasible, providing accurate and rapid diagnostic methods for AD and VaD diagnoses.

We conducted a scoping review to ascertain the landscape of ethics regulations for AD/ADRD research in Africa using Arksey and O'Malley's framework. We sourced regulations from the International Compilation of Human Research Standards. We included regulations from 14 countries published between 1997 and 2020. Provisions in the regulations applicable to research in AD/ADRD were part of broader sub-provisions for research such as with persons under legal disability. Regulations mostly required the appointment of Legally Authorised Representatives, as a major protection for persons with AD/ADRD. Provisions supporting capacity assessment and advance directives were only provided in regulations from five and two countries respectively. No regulation cited the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as a foundational instrument for its provisions. In conclusion, regulations specifically applicable to research among AD/ADRD or other cognitively impaired persons in Africa are scarce and provisions in existing regulations mostly lack specificity for practical implementation.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is an increasingly significant public health challenge worldwide, with Alzheimer’s disease being the most prevalent form of dementia. The objective of this study was burden of risk factors attributable to Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia and its relationship with the Socio-Demographic Index in Asian countries. METHODS: The present study is a population-based study. The 2021 Global Burden of Disease Study dataset for countries in the Asian continent was used in this study. Age-standardized rate (ASR) for incidence, mortality, prevalence, Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY), Years of Life Lost (YLL), Years Lived with Disability (YLD) and Annual Percentage Change (APC) were considered by gender and country. We assessed the trend for all index from 2010 to 2021. In addition, the association between socio-demographic index (SDI) and Alzheimer’s disease incidence and prevalnce was calculated using Pearson correlation analysis. RESULTS: The results indicated that the number and ASR of four indicators (incidence, prevalence, mortality, DALY, YLL, and YLD) from 1990 to 2021 were higher for women than for men. Metabolic risks and high fasting plasma glucose emerged as the primary risk factors for all four indicators. The percentage change in the risk factor associated with smoking for all four indicators decreased from 1990 to 2021, while the most significant increase was observed in the percentage change related to high body mass index. Additionally, the results demonstrated a positive and significant correlation between the Sociodemographic Index (SDI) and Age-Standardized Incidence Rate (ASIR) (r = 0.284, p = 0.04) as well as Age-Standardized Prevalence Rate (ASPR) (r = 0.281, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: According to the reported results, the burden of disease remains high in most countries. To alleviate this burden, it is essential to prioritize women and the elderly, and to implement more effective prevention and treatment measures.

With the introduction of specific or unspecific biomarkers, the diagnosis of dementia disorders has changed from a purely clinical to a biological construct. This review presents biomarkers for the most common neurodegenerative disorders. Specific biomarkers for misfolded proteins have been developed for Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Unspecific biomarkers for neurodegeneration, synaptic dysfunction and neuroinflammation may also be helpful in diagnosing or staging dementia disorders.

INTRODUCTION: The association of scam susceptibility with the timing of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia onset is unknown. METHODS: One thousand ninety-two older adults without dementia underwent assessments of scam susceptibility and annual clinical evaluations to document incident AD dementia. Accelerated failure time models examined the relation of scam susceptibility with dementia onset. RESULTS: During a mean of 5 years of follow-up (standard deviation = 3.1), 188 individuals (17%) were diagnosed with incident AD dementia. A higher level of scam susceptibility was associated with a considerably earlier dementia onset ( β  = -0.039; 95% confidence interval: -0.061, -0.017); those with a high level of susceptibility developed AD dementia at a mean age of 90.9 years compared to 98.2 for those with a low level. Results persisted after controlling for global cognition, sex, and education. DISCUSSION: Scam susceptibility is associated with a markedly earlier onset of AD dementia. Assessment of susceptibility may facilitate early identification of individuals at risk of developing dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: We examined whether scam susceptibility among older adults is associated with an accelerated onset of Alzheimer's disease dementia. Participants came from a large ongoing cohort study of aging. Scam susceptibility was assessed using a validated measure. Scam susceptibility was associated with a marked acceleration in dementia onset. Assessment of susceptibility may facilitate early identification of dementia.

INTRODUCTION: We aimed to compare gait between individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals and to evaluate the association between gait and regional amyloid beta (Aβ) burden in AD and DLB. METHODS: We included 420 participants (70 AD, 70 DLB, 280 CU) in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA). Gait was assessed using a pressure-sensor walkway. Aβ deposition was analyzed with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission topography (PET). RESULTS: The DLB group had reduced stride velocity, step length, and stride width variability, as well as increased double support percentage (%DS) and variability in step length, swing time, and step time compared to the AD and CU groups. Aβ burden was not associated with any gait outcomes. DISCUSSION: This study provides additional evidence that gait differs between AD and DLB. Larger studies are needed to investigate associations between Aβ burden and gait outcomes in dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: Gait was more impaired in dementia than in cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls. Compared with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) had more impaired pace, variability, and postural control. Step length and double support (%) distinguished DLB and AD with moderate accuracy.

Individuals from minoritized racial/ethnic groups face a disproportionate burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. This health inequality reflects structural racism, which creates and sustains racial differences in social determinants of health, including education access and quality, economic stability, social and community context, neighborhood and built environment, and health care access and quality. Thus, understanding pathways that lead to dementia inequalities requires addressing individual- and system-level factors. This article summarizes evidence linking each social determinant of health to racial/ethnic inequalities in dementia, emphasizing upstream factors and mechanisms as potential levels of intervention. The importance of resilience in marginalized groups as well as critical research considerations for dementia inequalities are also discussed. Future directions highlight the need to understand the common and unique mechanisms driving inequalities across minoritized groups, where research is lacking.

Nearly 7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia (ADRD). Timely detection, quality of care, and access to services for people with ADRD remain poor. Broad acceptance and implementation of quality standards may help improve care processes, outcomes, and inequities in ADRD care. We review existing quality measures for ADRD and identify care domains that lack well-developed measures or for which uptake of existing measures is low. Increasing the use of existing evidence-based ADRD quality measures for health system performance improvement, pragmatic research, and Alternative Payment Models like the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Guiding an Improved Dementia Experience (GUIDE) Model, launched in 2023, may promote changes in care delivery and help address disparities in dementia care. Highlights US dementia care needs better measurement tools to assess quality and inequities. Increased use of current Alzheimer's disease and related dementias quality measures is urgently needed to improve care. Consensus on high-quality dementia care is vital for health system expectations. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Guiding an Improved Dementia Experience (GUIDE) Model tests a new payment strategy to enhance dementia care quality. Other payers can boost measurement to drive quality care like the GUIDE Model.

BACKGROUND: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease dementia (EOAD) is characterized by more pronounced cognitive decline than late-onset AD dementia (LOAD). Characteristic performance in spoken language remains undefined. METHOD: A cross-sectional analysis of 1,189 people with EOAD and 4,646 with LOAD from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). RESULT: Based on data from their first NACC visit with AD, there was considerable heterogeneity in language performance across people with EOAD and LOAD. The distribution of naming ability was similar across these groups. On average, people with LOAD had better performance than people with EOAD for category fluency, letter fluency, and spoken lexical retrieval, and had lower Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR(®)) language scores, though there was considerable overlap in all of the distributions for people with EOAD and people with LOAD. DISCUSSION: At diagnosis, EOAD and LOAD language profiles are distinct. There is substantial variability in both groups in multiple aspects of language.

Late-onset depression (LOD) is closely linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), marked by shared biological pathways and common risk factors. The neurobiological alterations associated with depression, particularly the dysregulation of amyloid-β (Aβ), play a critical role in the acceleration of disease progression. In individuals suffering from LOD, Aβ peptides - specifically Aβ40 and Aβ42 - exhibit distinct profiles in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain tissue, highlighting the substantial influence of AD pathology. Central to this relationship is A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10), an essential α-secretase that exerts a protective effect by decreasing Aβ formation through the non-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Furthermore, ADAM10 regulates the shedding of Neuronal Growth Regulator 1 (Negr1), a protein intricately linked to both LOD and AD, thereby enhancing synaptic plasticity and neuronal development - two critical processes in addressing these challenging disorders. Given the rapidly rising prevalence of both depression and dementia in aging populations, understanding these molecular interactions is more urgent than ever. Despite growing evidence, the interplay among LOD, AD, ADAM10, and Negr1 remains insufficiently explored, particularly in diverse populations. This review synthesizes recent advancements that illuminate the complex interactions among LOD, AD, and the regulatory function of ADAM10, particularly concerning one of its substrates, Negr1. By elucidating these fundamental interactions, the study paves the way for innovative treatment approaches aimed at both LOD and AD, advocating for a synergistic strategy to address these multifaceted conditions effectively, meeting a critical and time-sensitive challenge in global brain health.

Autoimmune dementia is a new disease entity increasingly coming into focus, and novel neural antibodies associated with dementia and its precursors have been described. However, the significance of these novel and emerging autoantibodies in conjunction with cognitive disorders is unclear. Antibodies such as Leucin-Rich, Glioma Inactivated 1 (LGI1) and N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor (NMDAR) are already known to be pathogenic by triggering anomalies in synaptic plasticity and learning processes in animal models after having been transferred from humans to animals. In this review we describe various pathogenic mechanisms of antibodies such as complement dependent cytotoxicity, the internalization of membrane receptors, antagonistic effects, and alterations in vesicle endocytosis at the synaptic level. We also discuss established autoantibodies such as membrane-surface and intracellular antibodies in connection with cognitive disorders, as well as autoantibodies associated with neurodegenerative dementia, and autoimmune encephalitis with primary dementia syndrome. Test methods and the response to immunotherapy are also briefly explained. This overview provides a differentiated presentation of a heterogeneous dementia entity with its precursors, which requires more research to develop a differentiated treatment guideline.

INTRODUCTION: Ethnoracial groups face the highest risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) but remain underrepresented in research, exacerbating health disparities. Understanding barriers and effective recruitment strategies is critical for fostering inclusivity. The aim of this study was to synthesize evidence on strategies to engage, recruit, and retain historically minoritized groups in ADRD research. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using PubMed-MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and WEB OF SCIENCE. Studies focusing on ADRD research recruitment and retention among minoritized populations in the United States were included. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies identified key barriers, including mistrust, logistical challenges, and low awareness. Effective strategies involved long-term community engagement, culturally tailored education, participatory methods, and logistical support. DISCUSSION: Addressing systemic barriers through culturally competent strategies, digital tools, and community partnerships is essential for equitable research participation. Researchers and policy-makers must prioritize inclusive approaches to enhance representation and improve ADRD outcomes. HIGHLIGHTS: The study examined strategies for engaging, recruiting, and retaining historically underrepresented ethnoracial groups in ADRD. Successful engagement strategies encompass building trust through long-term community involvement, utilizing culturally tailored educational materials, and forming partnerships with community-based organizations. The study advocates for enhancing cultural competency, leveraging accessible digital tools, fostering community partnerships, addressing logistical barriers, and ensuring diverse representation in biomarker research.

Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and dementia are the leading neurodegenerative diseases that threaten the world with the aging population. Although the pathophysiology of each disease is unique, the steps to be taken to prevent diseases are similar. One of the changes that a person can make alone is to gain the habit of an antioxidant-rich diet. Phytochemicals known for their antioxidant properties have been reported to prevent neurodegenerative diseases in various studies. Phytochemicals with similar chemical structures are grouped. Accordingly, there are two main groups of phytochemicals, flavonoid and non-flavonoid. Various in vitro and in vivo studies on phytochemicals have proven neuroprotective effects by increasing cognitive function with their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms. The purpose of this review is to summarize the in vitro and in vivo studies on phytochemicals with neuroprotective effects and to provide insight.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the relationship between modifiable dementia risk factors and both dementia and cognitive decline. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) [2008-2020], the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) [2011-2020], and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) [2010-2020]. After adjusting for confounding factors, multivariable logistic regression was utilized to analyze the relationship between modifiable dementia risk factors and dementia, while multivariable linear regression was employed to examine the relationship between these risk factors and cognitive decline. Additionally, the Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the relationship between the number of risk factor events, clusters, and dementia risk. RESULTS: A total of 30,113 participants from HRS, CHARLS, and ELSA were included (44.6% male, mean age 66.04 years), with an average follow-up period of 7.29 years. A low education level was significantly associated with an increased risk of dementia and accelerated cognitive decline (Overall, OR = 2.93, 95% CI: 2.70-3.18; Overall, β = -0.25, 95% CI: -0.60 to-0.55). The presence of multiple dementia risk factors correlated with a higher dementia risk; Specifically, compared with more than 5 risk factor events, both having no dementia risk factors and having only one dementia risk factor were associated with a significantly lower risk of dementia (Overall, HR = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.11-0.22, HR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.18-0.25). Compared to the group with no coexistence of risk factors, the clusters of excessive alcohol, diabetes, vision loss, and hearing loss (HR = 4.11; 95% CI = 3.42-4.95; p < 0.001); excessive alcohol, vision loss, smoking, and hearing loss (HR = 5.18; 95% CI = 4.30-6.23; p < 0.001); and excessive alcohol, obesity, diabetes, and smoking (HR = 5.96; 95% CI = 5.11-6.95; p < 0.001) were most strongly associated with dementia risk. CONCLUSION: Among the 11 risk factors, educational attainment has the greatest impact on dementia risk and cognitive decline. A dose-response relationship exists between the number of modifiable risk factor events and dementia risk. The coexistence of multiple risk factors is associated with dementia risk, and these associations vary by risk factor cluster.

Patients with dementia face increased risks after general anesthesia. Improved perioperative electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring techniques could aid in identifying vulnerable patients. However, current technology relies on processed indices to measure "depth-of-anesthesia". Analyzing OpenNeuro Dataset ds004504, we compared resting-state, eyes-closed EEG recordings of healthy controls (n = 27) with patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 35) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD, n = 23). We focused on prefrontal recordings. Analysis included spectral analysis, the "fitting-oscillations&-one-over-f"-algorithm for aperiodic and periodic signal features, as well as calculations of openibis, permutation entropy (PeEn), spectral entropy (SpEn), and spectral edge frequency (SEF). Spectral differences were pronounced, including a higher alpha/theta-ratio of controls (2.62 [95%CI: 1.54-3.62]) compared to both AD (0.55 [95%CI: 0.26-1.92], P < 0.001, AUC: 0.765 [0.642-0.888]) and FTD (0.83 [95%CI: 0.33-1.65], P = 0.007, AUC: 0.779 [0.652-0.907]). Oscillatory peak detection within the alpha frequency band was more robust in control (versus AD: P = 0.003, Cramér's V = 0.374; versus FTD: P = 0.003, Cramér's V = 0.414). Processed index parameters did not show a clear trend. FTD was associated with a higher prefrontal openibis (95.53 [95%CI: 93.43-97.39]) than control (91.98 [95%CI: 89.46-96.27], P = 0.033, AUC: 0.717 [0.572-0.862]) and an elevated SEF (23.68 [95%CI: 14.10-25.57] Hz) compared to AD (16.60 [95%CI: 14.22-22.22] Hz, P = 0.041, AUC: 0.676 [0.532-0.821]). AD and FTD are associated with EEG baseline abnormalities, and a standard prefrontal montage, as used intraoperatively, could present a promising technical screening approach for cognitive vulnerability. However, these EEG features are obscured by processed index parameters currently used in neuroanesthesia monitoring.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury is an environmental risk factor that may accelerate the progression of Alzheimer's disease and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether traumatic brain injury in patients with mild cognitive impairment is associated with an increased risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. SETTING: National-level health data covering healthcare utilization, diagnoses, prescriptions, and procedures in South Korea from January 2012 to December 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016, were followed until Alzheimer's disease dementia diagnosis, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia occurrence, death, or December 31, 2021. These patients were classified into two groups according to the presence of traumatic brain injury during the follow-up period. MEASUREMENTS: Age at the time of mild cognitive impairment diagnosis, sex, income level, the presence of several chronic conditions, presence of traumatic brain injury, progression of Alzheimer's disease dementia, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia RESULTS: We assessed 452,718 patients (mean age: 67.16 years). Traumatic brain injury was significantly associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease dementia progression (hazard ratio = 1.252, 95 % confidence interval: 1.206-1.301), particularly among patients aged <65 years (hazard ratio = 1.560, 95 % confidence interval: 1.391-1.749), and was linked to a higher risk of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia following Alzheimer's disease dementia diagnosis (hazard ratio = 1.300, 95 % confidence interval: 1.181-1.431). CONCLUSIONS: Our results underscore the importance of traumatic brain injury prevention in patients with mild cognitive impairment for mitigating the progression and neuropsychiatric complications of Alzheimer's disease.

When the phenomenal rise of artificial intelligence (AI) with super-human capabilities is juxtaposed against the relentless decline of a person with dementia, it lends the impression that AI is more human than the person with progressive dementia. However, to accord a higher standing to AI intuits a limited appreciation of what it means to be human. This article explicates how confronting the present day realities of AI and dementia can remind us of the foundations of being human and inspire better care for those living with dementia.

INTRODUCTION: There is an unmet need for tools to quantify dementia risk during its multi-decade preclinical/prodromal phase, given that current biomarkers predict risk over shorter follow-up periods and are specific to Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Using high-throughput proteomic assays and machine learning techniques in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (n = 11,277), we developed the Dementia SomaSignal Test (dSST). RESULTS: In addition to outperforming existing plasma biomarkers, the dSST predicted mid-life dementia risk over a 20-year follow-up across two independent cohorts with different ethnic backgrounds (areas under the curve [AUCs]: dSST 0.68-0.70, dSST+age 0.75-0.81). In a separate cohort, the dSST was associated with longitudinal declines across multiple cognitive domains, accelerated brain atrophy, and elevated measures of neuropathology (as evidenced by positron emission tomography and plasma biomarkers). DISCUSSION: The dSST is a cost-effective, scalable, and minimally invasive protein-based prognostic aid that can quantify risk up to two decades before dementia onset. HIGHLIGHTS: The Dementia SomaSignal Test (dSST) predicts 20-year dementia risk across two independent cohorts. dSST outperforms existing plasma biomarkers in predicting multi-decade dementia risk. dSST predicts cognitive decline and accelerated brain atrophy in a third cohort. dSST is a prognostic aid that can predict dementia risk over two decades.

As both human longevity and diagnostic ability improve, more individuals are being diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia disease (Alzheimer's). Yet there is a paucity of new Alzheimer's research trials. One obstacle to research is the large number of Alzheimer's patients deemed incapable of providing informed consent for clinical research. Research advance directives (RADs) offer patients the opportunity to provide informed consent before incapacity occurs. However, critics question whether RADs guarantee informed consent, claiming that due to the nature of the disease, the consenting agent is no longer the same person after becoming incapacitated. This paper assesses the debate while using a conception of personhood, informed by the latest Alzheimer's research, which does not reduce the concept of personhood to psychological capacities. It explains how personal identity can persist despite Alzheimer's, such that RADs can and should suffice for informed consent.

OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by complex pathological mechanisms involving neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular dysfunction. Remote Ischemic Conditioning (RIC) has shown potential in addressing these pathways by improving cerebral blood flow, reducing oxidative stress, and modulating inflammatory responses. This protocol focuses on evaluating the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of RIC as a multi-target intervention for delaying cognitive decline in patients with mild Alzheimer's dementia, aiming to improve cognitive outcomes and overall quality of life. METHODS AND EXPECTED RESULTS: This study is a randomized, controlled, single-center, prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of RIC in patients with mild Alzheimer's dementia. Eligible participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the RIC group or a control group receiving sham RIC, with 20 patients in each group. Participants will receive either RIC or sham RIC once daily over a 3-month period. Outcome measures will assess cognitive function, psychological well-being, and inflammatory and neurodegenerative biomarkers. Psychiatric adverse events will be monitored throughout the treatment using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17). Cognitive function and daily living abilities will be evaluated at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-treatment using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scales. In addition, blood samples will be collected at each time point to measure plasma biomarkers of β-amyloid species and serum inflammatory cytokines to assess potential changes in cognitive decline, disease progression, and inflammation. The primary endpoint is safety, with the expectation that RIC will not increase psychiatric adverse events as reflected in HAMA and HAMD-17 scores. Primary efficacy endpoints include improvements in MMSE, MoCA, CDR, and ADL scores, indicating potential cognitive benefits and enhanced daily functioning. Secondary endpoints will analyze biomarkers to evaluate disease progression and inflammation levels before and after treatment. CONCLUSION: This trial aims to determine the safety, feasibility, and potential effectiveness of RIC as a multi-target intervention for mild Alzheimer's dementia by integrating cognitive and neuropsychological assessments with biological markers, providing a foundation for future studies.

INTRODUCTION: Low health literacy about Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) may limit help-seeking, early detection, and enrollment in clinical trials, particularly in minoritized communities. We created the Dementia Literacy Assessment (DeLA) to improve ADRD health literacy. METHODS: The DeLA, a storytelling method that included culturally adaptable vignettes embedded with important factoids about ADRD, was administered to 213 participants from urban and rural regions of Palm Beach and Broward County in Florida and 193 participants in American Samoa. RESULTS: The DeLA increased dementia health literacy and performed well across different participant characteristics (age, sex, education, geographic locale, race, ethnicity, and cognitive performance). Gains in ADRD health literacy were associated with older age, more education, better socioeconomic status, greater resilience, and better cognitive performance. DISCUSSION: Increasing ADRD health literacy could increase health-seeking behaviors in diverse populations for treatment, enrich recruitment into clinical trials, and may help reduce disparities in health outcomes. HIGHLIGHTS: Low health literacy about Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) may limit help-seeking, early detection, and enrollment in clinical trials, particularly in minoritized communities.The Dementia Literacy Assessment (DeLA), a storytelling method that included culturally adaptable vignettes embedded with important factoids about ADRD, was administered to 406 participants from urban and rural regions of Palm Beach and Broward County in Florida and American Samoa (11.8% White, 39.8% Black or African American, and 48.4% Pacific Islander [predominantly Samoan] individuals).The DeLA increased dementia health literacy and performed well across different participant characteristics (age, sex, education, geographic locale, race, and cognitive performance).Gains in ADRD health literacy were associated with older age, more education, better socioeconomic status, greater resilience, and better cognitive performance.Increasing ADRD health literacy could increase health-seeking behaviors in diverse populations for treatment, enrich recruitment into clinical trials, and help reduce disparities in health outcomes.

AIMS: Catecholamine analysis and studies to modulate dopamine and norepinephrine in dementia have had contradictory results. We aimed to analyze the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of L-DOPA, dopamine, and norepinephrine of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and normal controls (NC), and their relationship with clinical variables. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional, observational study, to analyze CSF L-DOPA, dopamine, and norepinephrine levels in 35 patients with AD, 16 with FTD, and 38 NC. RESULTS: L-DOPA was significantly lower in AD than NC (AD vs NC p = 0.039, DFT vs NC p = 0.052, DFT vs DA p = 1.00). Norepinephrine was positively correlated with age (r = 0.343, p = 0.035). Dopamine was higher in participants under antidepressive medication (p = 0.022among all participants; p = 0.046 in NC). CONCLUSION: This is the first study reporting lower CSF L-DOPA levels in AD. Similar norepinephrine levels despite locus coeruleus neurons loss in AD point to compensatory mechanisms that could exacerbate L-DOPA deficiency.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine balance, fall risk, and kinesiophobia in individuals with Alzheimer's Dementia (AD). METHODS: The study was completed with 18 AD and 18 healthy AD-free control group with early or moderate-stage AD diagnosed by a neurologist. Socio-demographic characteristics of the individuals were assessed using an evaluation form, and their balance was evaluated using the Tinetti Balance and Gait Assessment Test, Timed Up and Go Test, and Single Leg Standing Test. The Falls Risk Self-Assessment Scale (FRSAS) was used to assess the risk of falls. Kinesiophobia was assessed using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TKS). Additionally, participants underwent the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). RESULT: The mean age of individuals with AD was lower than that of healthy individuals, with means of 69 ± 3.66 years and 65.4 ± 4.10 years, respectively (p = 0.012). The Tinetti balance (p = 0.005), Tinetti gait (p < 0.001), Tinetti total (p < 0.001), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (p < 0,001) scores were lower in AD individuals relative to controls. The FRSAS (p < 0.001) scores were higher in AD individuals relative to controls. The TKS scores were found to be similar between individuals with AD and the control group (p = 0.860). CONCLUSION: It was found that individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have poorer balance and a higher risk of falls compared to healthy individuals. In light of these results, balance assessments should be included when developing rehabilitation protocols for individuals with AD. Treatment protocols designed for this patient group must incorporate balance-specific exercise and training programs. Additionally, individual and environmental preventive measures should be implemented to reduce the risk of falls in individuals with AD. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trial Number: NCT05201768.

The VA Million Veteran Program (MVP) is a nationwide initiative that seeks to examine how genes influence health and behaviors in military veterans. An article by Merritt et al. analyzing data from the MVP, developing and testing algorithms to query dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnoses from the VA's electronic health record system and examining genetic factors, provides an extraordinarily important contribution to the dementia and AD fields. The analyses presented in the article show how large databases can be used to further understand dementia and AD, pointing the way for many more important advances for this field.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) is a common cognitive disease in Japan. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is regarded as an early, but abnormal state of cognitive impairment, and amnestic MCI (aMCI) as a precursor of ADD. The Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R) and the similar Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) are quick cognitive assessments widely used in Japan. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are commonly assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). However, when the different types of BPSD appear and how they progress with the progression of ADD is not clear. METHODS: A total of 553 outpatients with ADD or aMCI participated. We divided the patients into six cognitive function groups. We examined the relationship between the individual NPI-Q domain scores and cognitive function to reveal the appearance and progression of BPSD. We also examined the relationship of the NPI-Q domains with the HDS-R and MMSE domains to reveal the cognitive functions that affect the BPSD. RESULTS: Our results suggested that hallucinations, agitation/aggression, anxiety, irritability/lability appeared in association with high MMSE scores and progressed slowly. Apathy/indifference and aberrant motor behaviors appeared in association with middle MMSE scores and progressed slowly. Delusions and nighttime behavior disturbances appeared in association with high MMSE score and progressed consistently with the ADD. Memory and orientation were the cognitive functions most related to NPI-Q domain scores and thus to progression of BPSD. CONCLUSIONS: Memory and orientation may be the most important cognitive functions related to the progression of BPSD in patients with ADD.

BACKGROUND: The differential diagnosis between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other causes of dementia is essential but challenging. Therefore, there is an increasing need for early, reliable, and non-invasive tests to distinguish between different forms of dementia. AIMS: To determine whether neuropsychological tests assessing visuospatial function can improve confidence in the clinical diagnosis of AD. METHODS: Retrospective observational single-center cohort study involving all patients consecutively referred to our outpatient clinic for cognitive disorders who underwent neuropsychological assessment between 2013 and 2018. In addition to demographic and functional variables, each patient underwent neuropsychological tests to assess cognitive performance, memory, and executive, language, and visuospatial ability, according to clinical protocols. The clinical diagnosis of cognitive disorders, based on standard diagnostic criteria, served as the gold standard. Accuracy measures of visuospatial tests to diagnose AD were calculated. Additionally, a new index derived from the sum of four items (Rey-Osterrieth figure copying, Copy of Drawings, Clock Drawing Test, and years of schooling) was tested (ReDCOOL). RESULTS: Of the 342 patients analyzed, 308 were diagnosed with dementia or mild cognitive impairment, including 60 with AD. AD patients exhibited the worst performance in visuospatial tests, and the utilization of the ReDCOOL index proved to be more dependable in identifying AD compared to other tests (AUROC 0.729, 95%CI 0.659-0.799; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The ReDCOOL index appears to increase confidence in the clinical diagnosis of AD compared to each of the visuospatial tests considered. Furthermore, this index is easily calculated and does not prolong the time needed for clinical evaluation, as it does not require a customized patient assessment.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) affects 6.9 million senior Americans and is a leading cause of death. Aspiration pneumonia carries high mortality but remains underexamined in this group. This study explores mortality patterns in this group to identify disparities among demographics. METHODS: We analyzed data from the CDC WONDER, focusing on mortality caused by the co-occurrence of AD and aspiration pneumonitis in adults aged 65 years and older from 1999 to 2020. Joinpoint Regression Program was employed to evaluate temporal trends. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs), crude mortality rates (CMRs) and annual percent changes (APCs) were computed. RESULTS: A total of 335,458 deaths occurred due to AD and aspiration pneumonia. The overall AAMR increased, with a significant increase from 1999 to 2001. Men had consistently higher AAMRs than women. AAMRs were highest among non-Hispanic (NH) Whites and lowest in NH Asians. CMR for the 85+ year age group was nearly four times higher than the 75-84 year age group. CONCLUSION: Aspiration pneumonitis caused a large number of deaths in older adults with AD with some groups being more vulnerable. These results point to ongoing disparities and emphasize the importance of better preventive care and targeted interventions to reduce preventable deaths in these vulnerable groups.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) may lead to different cognitive profiles. The performance on single language tests have been investigated in these patient-groups, but few studies have compared DLB and AD patients' language performances on different types of tests. The aim was to compare performances for patients with DLB, AD and healthy controls on different aspects of language function. Boston Naming Test, Naming of famous faces and verbal fluency (both semantic and lexical) were investigated in 90 DLB patients, 77 matched AD patients (MMSE score ≥ 21), and in a control group (N = 61). The patients had significantly lower scores on all tests compared to controls. The AD patients scored significantly lower than DLB patients on naming measures whereas the lexical fluency score was significantly lower in DLB. No significant differences were found for the semantic fluency. The frequency of impairment on the Boston Naming Test was higher in AD as compared to DLB, whereas the frequency of impairment on the lexical fluency test was significantly higher in DLB. In conclusion, DLB may lead to a different language profile than AD, and performance on language-based tests may help to differentiate patients with AD and DLB.

In recent decades, the use of certain oral anticholinergics for the treatment of hyperhidrosis has become widespread, often off-label but supported by multiple studies, including clinical trials, demonstrating their effectiveness and an apparently good safety profile. Similarly, various studies published in recent years have associated the use of anticholinergics to the development of dementia, particularly in elderly patients. Additionally, other studies have suggested that hyperhidrosis itself may be an early symptom of developing dementia. However, to date, no research has specifically linked the use of oral anticholinergics for hyperhidrosis treatment with the development of dementia. We present the currently available data on this controversial topic.

BACKGROUND: Depression is often cited as a major modifiable risk factor for dementia, though the relative contributions of a true causal relationship, reverse causality and confounding factors remain unclear. This study applied a subset of the Bradford Hill criteria for causation to depression and dementia including strength of effect, specificity, temporality, biological gradient and coherence. METHODS: A total of 491 557 participants in UK Biobank aged between 40 and 69 at enrolment and followed up for a mean duration of 12.4 years were studied. Diagnoses of depression and dementia were ascertained from linked health records, self-reports and death certificate registration. Depressive symptoms were measured at enrolment using a combination of questions based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression screening questionnaire. Regional grey matter volumes were measured using T1-weighted MRI in 41 929 participants. RESULTS: Depression was a strong risk factor for incident dementia with an OR of 1.76 (95% CI 1.63 to 1.90), a relationship which was found to be specific to depression rather than commonly proposed confounders. Depressive symptoms increased rapidly in the 10 years prior to dementia diagnosis. The severity of depressive symptoms showed a dose-response relationship with dementia risk. Depression at older ages correlated with reduced grey matter volume in an Alzheimer's pattern whereas younger onset depression was associated with reduced grey matter volume in the frontal lobes and cerebellum. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the link between depression and dementia is due to reverse causation with a smaller component of causation with clear evidence of both mechanisms driving the association.

BACKGROUND: Time to dementia diagnosis is a major barrier to effective care, particularly in resource-limited settings such as Latin America. Barriers to timely dementia diagnosis include the lack of access to comprehensive neuropsychological testing, cognitive specialists, and advanced diagnostic tools. Brief cognitive assessments, such as the Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS) and INECO Frontal Screening (IFS) offer promise for diverse populations, and may help in specific dementia subtypes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the efficacy of RUDAS and IFS in comparison to the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE). METHODS: A total of 243 participants (70 normal cognition Controls, 62 PD with normal cognition, 46 PDD, and 75 AD) were recruited as part of an observational cross-sectional study at a cognitive clinic in Peru. Diagnosis was based on clinical criteria and confirmed with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Participants underwent cognitive assessment using RUDAS, IFS, and MMSE. RESULTS: Both RUDAS and IFS differentiated dementia from normal cognition groups with 100% specificity, compared to 53% for MMSE. The IFS identified early cognitive changes in PD (median score: PD = 24; Controls = 27, p < 0.001). RUDAS was particularly effective in distinguishing AD and PDD using the memory and visuospatial tasks. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that RUDAS and IFS can enable faster and clearer diagnoses for dementia subtypes, offering clinicians and community health workers practical tools to improve care in resource-limited settings where comprehensive evaluations are not always feasible.

A lack of diversity in Alzheimer's (AD) and dementia research is an important barrier to identifying strategies for prevention and treatment. Research suggests media coverage of AD/dementia research will familiarize people with the issue and motivate them to place more importance in the issue in general. This study explores how news media may inform groups that are under-represented in AD/dementia through coverage of the issue. A national survey identified the media outlets that were most often consumed and used for health information within target populations. Transcripts from these media outlets were content analyzed to examine AD/dementia coverage. The timeframe included the months before and after the US FDA's approval of the drug Aduhelm and the controversy surrounding it. Results highlight differences in under-represented groups' media consumption patterns and coverage of AD/dementia and indicates a failure to inform about an event that may have widespread effect on Medicare and AD/dementia research.

INTRODUCTION: Technological advancements like digital monitoring tools, disease-modifying therapies, and artificial intelligence have been shown to improve the clinical management of neurocognitive diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). To enhance implementation in daily practice, users' input is essential in the technology development process. This study aimed to determine clinician's perspective of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) in the management of dementia and AD. METHOD: A survey was conducted targeting clinicians practicing in the field of dementia across Europe. A sixty-five-item digital questionnaire was administered, and opinions were inquired across the domains of diagnosis, disease-modifying therapy, and prognosis, including factors that affect tool implementation and utilization. RESULTS: Eighty-four clinicians (including specialist physicians, psychologists, and nurses) responded to this survey, and more than 50% had no knowledge or experience with CDSS. Most of the respondents reported the ability to predict the likelihood of AD as the most important diagnostic function. It was surprising to find the middling responses for the ability to predict amyloid positivity. The majority indicated assessment of treatment eligibility for disease-modifying therapy as vital, and the ability to predict cognitive and functional decline as the most important prognostic functions. Data accuracy and ease of use were noted as most necessary to facilitate CDSS adoption and implementation. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study contribute to the future development of CDSS in this field, especially regarding the approval and imminent use of disease-modifying therapies, a comprehensive tool that is precise and user friendly would improve clinical decisions and efficiency.

Investigating plasma proteomic signatures of dementia offers insights into its pathology, aids biomarker discovery, supports disease monitoring, and informs drug development. Here, we analyzed data from 48,367 UK Biobank participants with proteomic profiling. Using Cox and generalized linear models, we examined the longitudinal associations between proteomic signatures and dementia-related phenotypes. Mendelian randomization analysis was employed to identify causal associations, and machine learning algorithms were applied to develop protein-based models for dementia prediction. We identified 74 proteins significantly associated with the risk of various types of dementia and cognitive functions after Bonferroni correction. Among these, strong associations were observed for growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light polypeptide (NEFL), across all types of dementia. Additionally, 15 proteins demonstrated significant associations with neuroimaging-defined dementia endophenotypes. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses further substantiated causal relationships between dementia-associated proteins and Alzheimer's disease, particularly involving GDF15, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ret (RET), and GFAP. Moreover, we identified three protein modules associated with dementia, primarily linked to immune system processes, angiogenesis, and energy metabolism, providing insights into potential biological pathways underlying the disease. Furthermore, we proposed a ten-protein panel capable of forecasting dementia over a median follow-up period of 8.6 years, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.857 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.837-0.876). Our results revealed dementia-associated plasma proteomic signatures, and their causal relationships, notably GDF15-RET signaling with Alzheimer's disease, and proposed a promising protein panel for high-risk dementia screening.

We analyzed how cardiovascular disease subtypes influence the prevalence and incidence of dementia among 30,582 individuals aged 50 and older in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center cohort. We calculated prevalence ratios (aPR) and hazard ratios (aHR), using models adjusted for age, sex, race, years of education, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Stroke (aPR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.20-1.32) and history of arrhythmias (aPR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.09-1.24) were associated with higher dementia prevalence. In survival analysis, stroke was associated with a 55% increased risk of incident dementia (aHR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.36-1.77).

OBJECTIVE: To determine associations of alleles of rs11146020 (GRIN1) and rs3764028 (GRIN2B), encoding subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, with the age at Alzheimer's disease dementia onset and with behavioral symptoms in each dementia stage, mediated by APOE (apolipoprotein E gene) ε4 carriership. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving consecutive outpatients with Alzheimer's disease dementia assessed for demographic features, Clinical Dementia Rating, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, genotyped for rs7412 and rs429358 (APOE, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reactions), rs11146020 and rs3764028 (Polymerase Chain Reactions). Genetic variants were associated with the age at dementia onset, and with behavioral symptoms at each dementia stage (adjusted for sex, age at dementia onset, and psychotropic drug therapy). RESULTS: Considering 210 patients: 68.1% were women, 52.4% were APOE-ε4 carriers, all single nucleotide polymorphisms in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. APOE-ε4/ε4 carriers had earlier dementia onset, as well as carriers of rs11146020-G or rs3764028-C, particularly when they were APOE-ε4 non-carriers, p < 0.001. Mildly impaired rs11146020-G carriers had less aberrant motor behavior when they were APOE-ε4 carriers (p = 0.044). For moderately impaired rs3764028-A carriers, APOE-ε4 carriers had higher Neuropsychiatric Inventory total scores (p = 0.001), while APOE-ε4 non-carriers had more delusions (p = 0.003). Still in moderate dementia, rs11146020-C carriers had more aberrant motor behavior when they were APOE-ε4 carriers (p = 0.032), and rs11146020-G carriers had less apathy (p = 0.039) and more disinhibition (p = 0.032) when they were APOE-ε4 carriers. No associations survived corrections for false discovery rates in severe dementia. CONCLUSION: Alleles rs11146020-G and rs3764028-C lead to earlier dementia onset with a mostly milder disease course while softening the behavioral burden.

BACKGROUND: Timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains challenging in the United Kingdom and improvements are needed with the introduction of new therapies. OBJECTIVE: To examine the United Kingdom diagnostic and current treatment journey for people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia to identify future opportunities for new treatments. METHODS: Physician-reported data were drawn from the Adelphi Real World Dementia Disease Specific Programme™, a cross-sectional survey of physicians treating patients with MCI or AD dementia in the United Kingdom between 2022 and 2024. Analyses were descriptive. RESULTS: Physicians (n = 109) reported data for 717 patients with MCI or AD dementia (including 264 with MCI or mild dementia). Overall median (interquartile range) time from symptom onset to first consultation was 26.0 (9.1-52.9) weeks. Time from consultation to diagnosis, for patients not diagnosed at initial consultation, was 15.2 (5.1-21.0) weeks for patients who first consulted and were diagnosed by a general practitioner and 21.9 (12.6-39.0) weeks for those who consulted a general practitioner and were diagnosed by a specialist. Few patients (4.9%) had a biomarker-confirmed diagnosis. Delays due to waiting for specialist referrals and diagnostic tests were reported for 57.6% and 26.9% of patients, respectively. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were the most common first-line treatment (82.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlighted delays in AD diagnosis and potential areas for United Kingdom health system improvement. Expediting timely diagnosis through increased public awareness, expanded biomarker use and addressing disparities in services is crucial to maximize access to emerging new therapies.

The functions of the heart and brain are closely linked and essential to support human life by the heart-brain axis, which is a complex interconnection between the heart and brain. Also, cardiac function and cerebral blood flow regulate the brain's metabolism and function. Therefore, deterioration of cardiac function may affect cognitive function and may increase the risk of dementia. Cardiogenic dementia is defined as a cognitive deterioration due to heart diseases such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation. The prevalence of cognitive impairment in patients with heart failure was 29%. In addition, coronary artery disease (CAD) is also associated with the development of cognitive impairment. CAD and reduction of myocardial contractility reduced cerebral blood flow and increased the risk of dementia in CAD patients. Furthermore, myocardial infarction and subsequent systemic haemodynamic instability promote the development and progression of cardiogenic dementia. These findings indicated that many cardiac diseases are implicated in the development and progression of cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism for the development of cardiogenic dementia was not fully elucidated. Consequently, this review aims to discuss the potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of cardiogenic dementia.

OBJECTIVE: Brain atrophy measured by structural imaging has been used to quantify resilience against neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Considering glucose hypometabolism is another marker of neurodegeneration, we quantified metabolic resilience (MR) based on Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) and investigated its clinical implications. METHODS: We quantified the MR and other resilience metrics, including brain resilience (BR) and cognitive resilience (CR), using partial least squares path modeling from the ADNI database. A linear mixed-effects model and a Cox proportional hazards model were used to identify the impact of each resilience on longitudinal cognitive function and conversion to dementia, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 848 participants were included in this study. All resilience metrics (CR, BR, and MR) were associated with slower cognitive decline. Results from the ANOVA test, AIC and BIC values showed that the additional inclusion of MR improved the performances of the linear mixed effect models. In survival analysis, all resilience variables were negatively associated with the risk of conversion to dementia. In line with the results of the linear mixed effects models, the additional inclusion of MR into the models with different resilience variables increased the C-index. CONCLUSION: Relative preservation of brain glucose metabolism is a valuable predictor of future cognitive decline and conversion to dementia, adding value to existing resilience metrics. While the utility of FDG PET in clinical settings is limited by cost and accessibility, it might have potential usefulness as a prognostic marker, especially in a context of resilience.

Dementia education can be an effective pedagogical tool to improve student perceptions of dementia and dementia care. In this article, we describe four evidence-based educational initiatives implemented in an undergraduate and graduate level social work course. Students participated in an informational presentation on dementia, a dementia simulation, and a virtual discussion board. They also conducted an interview with a person living with dementia and their caregiver. Twenty-nine students completed a pre- and postsurvey on their (a) prior contact with individual(s) living with dementia, (b) dementia-related knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy, and (c) willingness to support individuals living with dementia, and 43 students participated in a focus group. Comparison of pre- and post-participation scores indicated improvements in knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy. Content analyses of focus group responses and discussion posts generated themes that shed light on students' (a) knowledge gains at cognitive and affective levels, (b) attitudes toward future practice in dementia care, (c) perceived value of interprofessional practice, and (d) perceptions of dementia related learning activities. Despite limitations in implementation and evaluation, the curricular initiatives provide a template to train future health professionals in dementia care, a vital area of practice.

The early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia remains a critical challenge, particularly with traditional machine learning models which often fail to provide transparency in their predictions, reducing user confidence and treatment effectiveness. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an explainable and lightweight deep learning framework comprising temporal convolutional networks and long short-term memory networks that efficiently classifies Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and healthy controls using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Feature engineering has been conducted using modified Relative Band Power (RBP) analysis, leveraging six EEG frequency bands extracted through power spectrum density (PSD) calculations. The model achieves high classification accuracies of 99.7% for binary tasks and 80.34% for multi-class classification. Furthermore, to enhance the transparency and interpretability of the framework, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has been utilized as an explainable artificial intelligence technique that provides insights into feature contributions.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the potential value of enlarged perivascular space (EPVS) volume as a biomarker for distinguishing between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD) in older people. METHODS: A total of 93 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 122 patients with vascular dementia, all aged > 65 years and diagnosed via clinical and neuropsychological assessments, were enrolled in this study. A deep learning model based on VB-Net was utilized to automatically quantify the EPVS volume in four brain regions: the basal nuclei (BN), centrum semiovale (CSO), temporal lobe (T), and midbrain (MB). Univariate analysis was conducted to compare the clinical data and EPVS volume characteristics across different regions between patients with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Multivariate analysis was employed to identify independent factors for distinguishing AD from VD, and the discriminative ability was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that, in comparison with the AD group, the VD group had a higher proportion of patients with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and lacune, along with a higher Fazekas score for white matter hyperintensities, an increased volume of BN-EPVS, and decreased volumes of CSO-EPVS and T-EPVS (all p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that BN-EPVS, CSO-EPVS, and T-EPVS volumes were independent factors influencing the differentiation of dementia subtypes (all p < 0.05). Furthermore, ROC curve analysis revealed that the areas under the curve for BN-EPVS, CSO-EPVS, and T-EPVS volumes in distinguishing dementia subtypes were 0.791, 0.712, and 0.700, respectively. CONCLUSION: There exist spatial disparities in the volumetric distribution of EPVS between AD and VD. The volume of EPVS at various locations can serve as a reliable imaging biomarker for the differential diagnosis of these two dementia subtypes.

Background Large language models such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Gemini are increasingly used to generate patient-facing medical content. While their factual accuracy has been explored, the readability of these outputs remains less well understood. Readability is a crucial component of health communication, particularly for older adults and those with lower health literacy. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the readability of patient information leaflets generated by three large language models - ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Gemini - on the topics of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and delirium, using five validated readability metrics. Materials and methods We conducted a cross-sectional comparative study of patient information leaflets generated by three large language models on the topics of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and delirium. Each model was prompted using identical queries, and the resulting texts were evaluated using five established readability metrics: Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) Index, and Automated Readability Index. Readability scores were compared using Kruskal-Wallis tests to identify statistically significant differences between models. Results ChatGPT consistently produced the most readable content, with the highest Flesch Reading Ease scores and the lowest grade-level indices. DeepSeek generated text that was markedly more complex and less accessible. Gemini performed intermediately, sometimes matching ChatGPT in specific indices but not consistently across all metrics. The difference in Flesch Reading Ease scores between models was statistically significant (H = 7.20, p = 0.027). Other metrics showed trends that approached significance. Conclusions There are meaningful differences in the readability of patient information generated by different large language models. ChatGPT appears to produce content that is more suitable for patient understanding, particularly in the context of older adult care. These findings highlight the need for careful evaluation of readability when using generative AI in clinical communication. Future research should incorporate expert review of content accuracy and appropriateness alongside readability.

BACKGROUND: Aggregation of cohort data increases precision for studying neurodegenerative disease pathways, but efforts to combine data and expertise are often hampered by infrastructural, ethical and legal considerations. We aimed to unite various cohort studies in the Netherlands to enhance research infrastructure and facilitate research on dementia etiology and its public health implications. METHODS: The Netherlands Consortium of Dementia Cohorts (NCDC) includes participants with initially no established cognitive impairment from 9 Dutch cohorts: the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (ADC), Doetinchem Cohort Study (DCS), European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease (EMIF-AD), Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA), the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS), The Maastricht Study, the Memolife substudy of the Lifelines cohort, Rotterdam Study and Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease-Magnetic Resonance (SMART-MR) study. The objectives of NCDC are to improve data infrastructure and access to cohorts related to aging and dementia, investigate the role of Alzheimer's disease and vascular pathology in the development of dementia and estimate the public health impact of established dementia risk factors by assessing their relative contribution to the population burden of dementia. RESULTS: We increased the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR) status of the cohorts through harmonization of data across cohorts, implementation of medical imaging repositories for scan management, implementation of the Personal Health Train infrastructure and provision of meta-data in existing cohort catalogues. We established the ethical and legal frameworks required for federated and pooled analyses and performed the first remote federated data analyses using the Personal Health Train infrastructure. To determine biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, 2554 plasma samples were analyzed centrally. Federated, pooled, and coordinated meta-analyses have led to multiple publications in the context of NCDC. CONCLUSION: The combination of population-based and clinical cohorts, the coordinated assessment of plasma markers in previously collected samples and implementation and use of the Personal Health Train infrastructure for federated analysis are both feasible and promising for future collaborative efforts.

PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between living arrangements and discharge disposition, and how this relationship differs by the rural or urban characteristics of the patient's residence among home health care patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD). METHODS: This retrospective study used the 2019 Outcome and Assessment Information Set and the Master Beneficiary Summary File. Our study was based on 531,269 Medicare fee-for-service patients with ADRD. We used linear probability regression models to examine the relationship between discharge disposition (to the community vs. an institution) and living arrangements, including an interaction term for rural-urban residence. FINDINGS: Patients in rural areas (19.8%) were more likely to live alone than those in urban areas (15.2%). Our main results show that patients living at home with others (coefficient: -0.02, p-value < 0.001) or alone (coefficient: -0.03, p-value < 0.001) were less likely to be discharged to the community compared to patients who lived in congregate settings. Also, for patients with ADRD who lived in rural areas, living at home with others (rural*home with others; coefficient: -0.02, p-value < 0.001) or living alone (rural*home alone; coefficient: -0.03, p-value<0.001) were associated with additional lower probabilities of being discharged to their communities. CONCLUSIONS: A multidimensional approach considering living arrangements to support home health care patients with ADRD could be critical to achieving better health outcomes. Furthermore, implementing area-specific target interventions could be important for improving the care and health of patients with ADRD as well as reducing rural-urban disparities in discharge disposition.

BACKGROUND: Accurate assessment of cognitive impairment is essential to effective Alzheimer's disease (AD) management and research. However, the absence of validated methods to translate scores between widely used instruments-such as the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) in trials and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in clinical practice-poses a significant barrier. This limits data harmonization, impedes cross-study comparability, and complicates the integration of clinical and research evidence. Bridging this gap is critical for consistent staging, longitudinal monitoring, and data-driven decision-making in AD and related dementias. OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate bidirectional score conversion tables between CDR-SB and MoCA using a large, diverse cohort spanning the full spectrum of cognitive function. DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional analysis using equipercentile equating with log-linear smoothing. Optimal smoothing parameters were selected by minimizing mean squared error, Akaike Information Criterion, and Bayesian Information Criterion. Concordance was assessed using Spearman's rank correlation and Bland-Altman plots. SETTING: National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), aggregating standardized assessments from 35 U.S.-based Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers. PARTICIPANTS: 23,717 individuals (59,871 visits) with same-day CDR-SB and MoCA assessments from January 2015 to September 2024, spanning normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia. INTERVENTION: None; this was a secondary analysis of existing data. MEASUREMENTS: Primary measures included CDR-SB (0-18; higher = greater impairment) and MoCA (0-30; higher = better cognition). Bidirectional crosswalk tables were derived using equipercentile equating. RESULTS: CDR-SB and MoCA scores showed strong inverse correlation (Spearman's ρ = -0.68; p < 0.001). Crosswalk tables demonstrated good agreement across the cognitive spectrum and performed consistently in the full cohort and an AD-specific subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first validated, bidirectional CDR-SB-MoCA crosswalk, supporting data harmonization and consistent interpretation of cognitive severity across research and clinical settings.

ObjectiveApathy and APOE ε4 genotype are risk factors for developing Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD). Antidepressant use is known to induce apathy. This study aimed to examine associations between APOE ε4, apathy, and antidepressant use with progression from cognitively normal (CN) to mild cognitive impairments (MCI), and MCI to ADD.MethodsParticipants aged 55-90 were recruited from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Participants were CN or had MCI at baseline and had completed at least 3 consecutive study visits. The NPI and NPI-Q apathy subscales were used to index the presence of apathy. Antidepressants used by participants included SSRIs, SNRIs, and AYTADs. Cox proportional hazards analyses examined the combined effects of apathy, APOE ε4 genotype, and antidepressant use on conversion from CN to MCI and from MCI to ADD.ResultsApathy and APOE ε4 were associated with increased risk of conversion along the CN-MCI-ADD continuum. Antidepressant use was associated with progression from MCI to ADD, and progression from CN to MCI in non-apathetic APOE ε4 carriers.ConclusionOur findings support apathy and APOE ε4 as robust predictors of conversion to MCI and ADD, and demonstrate novel associations between antidepressant use and conversion. Future research should explore whether antidepressant use in MCI and ADD causes apathetic symptoms or serves to index apathy/depression severity.

Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) significantly impacts Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (AD/ADRD) mortality. South Carolina has a high incidence of CVD and dementia mortality. The aim of this study, therefore, was to examine the neurological causes of death and the leading causes of death in the South Carolina Alzheimer's Disease Registry (SCADR). Method: Data from 2005-2018 were extracted from the SCADR using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. The top 10 leading causes of death (LCOD) were identified using death certificates. Some neurological causes of death were operationalized by combining related ICD codes, such as CVD_C (I219, I251, I500, I64) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COP_C), (J449, C349), and χ2 was used to compare socio-demographic characteristics and mortality. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using extended Cox Proportional Hazard modeling, adjusting for socio-demographic factors. Results: A total of 207,093 registry cases were included in the analysis. About 70% of cases had Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis, and 40% of all cases were 85 years and older. The LCOD was CVD_C (13.4%). The risk of death among cases with vascular dementia (VaD) was 1.17 times the risk of death among those with AD (aHR: 1.172, 95% CI: 1.148-1.196). Among all deaths, cases with COP_C had a significantly higher likelihood of death compared to those with CVD_C (aHR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.025-1.090). Conclusions: The study highlights CVD_C as the LCOD in frequency, with survival analysis indicating COP_C risk of death as significantly higher compared to CVD_C deaths. There is a need to prioritize CVD and lung-related comorbidity prevention, assessment, and management programs for individuals living with ADRD.

OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent age-related neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of individuals in the United States. Neuroinflammation is a driver of the neurodegenerative changes that characterize AD, prompting interest in how inflammation can be modulated for treatment and prevention. METHODS: ICD-10 codes were quarried from electronic medical records to identify patients diagnosed with AD from 2012 to 2020. The patients were then divided into those who used systemic steroids and those who did not before the progression of their disease. Data on medication prescribed was used to measure the disease's progression. Clinical findings and laboratory results were collected to build a propensity score. Patients were followed until disease progression, death, or the last available visit. Kaplan-Meier curves and hazard ratios adjusted for the propensity score were used to compare the two groups. RESULTS: Of the 459 patients identified, 77 were included in the study, and 13 used steroids. Of the 77 patients included in the study, 59 had progression of their disease, and of those, five used steroids. The median time to progression was 408.00 (191.00, 979.00) days for the overall sample. The hazard ratio (HR) comparing the group using steroids to those not using steroids was 0.26 with a 95% CI of (0.1013, 0.673) and a p value of 0.00064. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, steroid use delayed the progression of dementia. Further study is needed to outline how steroids and anti-inflammatory medications can be used in the treatment and prevention of AD.

The enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is present in high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles in blood plasma and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Its activity has been investigated in several oxidative-stress-related conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is convincing evidence that PON1 activity in blood is lower in AD patients than in healthy controls, but it is less clear whether there is a difference between the precursor stage of AD, known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI AD), and the dementia stage of AD. In the present study, we assessed PON1 status in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 32 patients with MCI AD, 56 patients with AD dementia, and 74 patients with non-AD dementia. We measured PON1 concentration as well as rates of hydrolysis and Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters K(m) and V(max) of PON1 for lactonase, arylesterase and arildialkylphosphatase activities in all the samples. There was no significant difference between AD dementia and MCI AD patients in any of the parameters measured. Within the AD group, we found that in blood plasma, rates of hydrolysis and V(max) negatively correlated with age in the case of lactonase and arylesterase. In CSF, the negative correlation with age for these parameters was even more pronounced. The correlation between age and PON1 status was more prominent in men for blood plasma and in women for CSF. The correlation between age and PON1 status was mostly absent in patients with other kinds of dementia, suggesting that PON1 activity decline is a part of development of AD pathology.

INTRODUCTION: Based on manual review of clinical notes of using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision coding, we evaluated the feasibility and validity for monitoring, recording, and reporting intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) events in patients with all-cause mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's dementia including, but not limited to, patients eligible for anti-amyloid therapy. METHODS: Principal and first-position hospital discharge codes for ICH events for 200 patients were identified from the Veterans Affairs Health System structured administrative database. Clinician manual review of discharge summary notes assessed and confirmed the presence of coded events. Available documentation of bleed locations was further reviewed, and the extent of event adjudication for potential etiology was assessed. Additionally, 25 acute ICH cases were randomly identified by reviewing discharge notes to confirm corresponding diagnostic code-based reporting. RESULTS: Of the 200 identified patients, 161 with acute ICH events were confirmed, resulting in a positive predictive value (PPV) of 80.5% for ICH event presence identified by diagnostic coding. Bleed locations were described for 151 of 161 patients with confirmed events. Of 110 cases whose diagnostic codes indicated an event location, 79 had location descriptions in discharge summaries that were consistent with the coding (PPV = 71.8%). Possible etiology was described in 56/161 patients' discharge summaries. Among the 25 acute ICH cases identified from discharge notes, 8 had corresponding ICH diagnostic codes. CONCLUSION: This study supports the feasibility and validity of the ICD-10 coding system for monitoring, recording, and reporting ICH event presence. When location is specified in the codes, the ICD-10 coding has an acceptable PPV. Overall, the current diagnostic coding system provides a reasonable framework for initial reporting and may allow for only limited inference of etiology such as differentiating nontraumatic versus traumatic events. Coding accuracy for ICH can be expected to further improve with the availability of guidelines, training, and standardization across clinical practices.

Alzheimer's Disease Dementia (ADD) prognosis is an unmet medical need. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an early AD etiopathogenic factor. The present study analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) methylation patterns in blood samples from patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who progressed to ADD (P), MCI remained stable (NP), and Cognitively Normal (CN) individuals. Differentially methylated sites were identified in the D-loop region in both CN vs. NP and NP vs. P comparisons, even before β-amyloid positivity. A Random Forest model was developed using mtDNA methylation data combined with cognitive and risk factor features. Model's performance was assessed by cross-validation and tested on an independent set, achieving 84.4% accuracy in training and 83.2% (95% CI: 75.2%-89.4%) in testing. For identifying P patients, sensitivity and specificity were 95.1% and 70.7%, respectively. The AUC-ROC was 90.3%. The developed model demonstrates predictive capacity in distinguishing cognitive decline and stability in MCI individuals, independently of their β-amyloid status.

Physiological linkage, which refers to the degree that people's peripheral physiological responses change in coordinated ways, has been linked to a variety of psychiatric and developmental conditions. In contrast, physiological linkage in neurological conditions has been understudied. Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is characterized by debilitating impairments in socioemotional functioning, including connections with others. We hypothesized that physiological linkage during interactions with loved ones would be reduced in bvFTD. During unrehearsed 10-min discussions of an area of disagreement in 86 dyads (n = 40 bvFTD; n = 35 Alzheimer's disease [AD]; n = 11 healthy controls), we computed dyadic physiological linkage using a composite of six peripheral physiological measures (i.e., heart rate, skin conductance, finger pulse amplitude, finger pulse transmission time, ear pulse transmission time, somatic activity). Specifically, we computed in-phase, anti-phase, and combined physiological linkage to examine each dyad's coordinated physiological changes that occur exclusively in the same direction (i.e., positively correlated), opposite direction (i.e., negatively correlated), or in either direction (i.e., correlated regardless of whether the correlation is positive or negative). Results indicate that bvFTD dyads had significantly lower combined (but not in-phase or anti-phase) physiological linkage compared to AD and healthy control dyads. To the extent that physiological linkage reflects social connection, these findings are consistent with the deficits in socio-emotional functioning that characterize bvFTD. We offer several possible explanations for this finding and consider implications for future research and clinical assessment of dyadic interpersonal processes in dementia and related disorders.

OBJECTIVES: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) usually shows more asymmetric atrophy patterns than Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aim to quantify this asymmetry to differentiate FTD, AD, and FTD subtypes. METHODS: We studied T1-MRI scans, including FTD (different phenotypes), AD, and healthy controls (CTR). We defined the Cortical Asymmetry Index (CAI) using measures based on a metric derived from information theory with the cortical thickness measures. Some participants had additional follow-up MRIs, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or plasma measures. We analysed differences at cross-sectional and longitudinal levels. We then clustered FTD and AD participants based on the CAI values and studied the patients' fluid biomarker characteristics within each cluster. RESULTS: A total of 101 FTD patients (64  ±  8 years, 53 men), 230 AD patients (65  ±  10 years, 84 men), and 173 CTR (59  ±  15 years, 67 men) were studied. CAI differentiated FTD, AD, and CTR. It also distinguished the semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) from the other FTD phenotypes. In FTD, the CAI increased over time. The cluster analysis identified two subgroups within FTD, characterised by different neurofilament-light (NfL) levels, and two subgroups within AD, with different plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels. In AD, CAI correlated with GFAP and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); in FTD, the CAI was associated with NfL levels. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method quantifies asymmetries previously described visually. The CAI could define clinically and biologically meaningful disease subgroups in the differential diagnosis of AD and FTD and its subtypes. CAI could also be of interest in tracking disease progression in FTD. KEY POINTS: Question There is a need to find quantitative metrics from MRI that can identify disease subgroups, and that could be useful for diagnosis and tracking. Findings We propose a Cortical Asymmetry Index that differentiates Alzheimer's disease (AD) from Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), distinguishes FTD subtypes, correlates with NFL and GFAP levels, and monitors FTD progression. Clinical relevance Our proposed index holds the potential to support clinical applications for diagnosis and disease tracking in AD and FTD, using a quantitative summary metric from MRI data. It also contributes to the understanding of these diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Little is known about whether neighborhood social and built environments influence Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia risk in South Asians. METHODS: We used data on 745 South Asians living in the US who were ≥40-years old. Neighborhood characteristics included percentage of Asian residents, Walk Score (walkability), and neighborhood social cohesion. We calculated an AD dementia risk score from age, gender, education, diabetes, hypertension, current smoking, low high-density lipoprotein, and high waist-to-hip ratio. Multivariable linear regression examined associations between neighborhood characteristics and AD dementia risk scores; interaction terms tested for differences by gender. RESULTS: Greater neighborhood social cohesion was associated with lower AD dementia risk scores in the overall sample. Stratifying by gender, the beneficial association was only observed for women and not men (interaction p-value: 0.01). CONCLUSION: Policies and interventions promoting neighborhood social cohesion may help reduce AD dementia risk among South Asian middle and older-age women in the US.

OBJECTIVE: Impairments in social interaction are common symptoms of dementia and necessitate the use of validated neuropsychological instruments to measure social cognition. We aim to investigate the Hinting Task - Dutch version (HT-NL), which measures the ability to infer intentions behind indirect speech to assess Theory of Mind, in dementia. METHOD: Sixty-six patients with dementia, of whom 22 had behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 21 had primary progressive aphasia, and 23 had Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 99 healthy control participants were included. We examined the HT-NL's psychometric properties, including internal consistency, between-group differences using analyses of covariance with Bonferroni-adjusted post hoc comparisons, discriminative ability and concurrent validity using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and construct validity using Spearman rank correlations with other cognitive tests. RESULTS: Internal consistency was acceptable (Cronbach's α = 0.74). All patient groups scored lower on the HT-NL than the control group. Patients with bvFTD scored lower than patients with AD dementia. The HT-NL showed excellent discriminative ability (AUC = 0.83), comparable to a test of emotion recognition (ΔAUC = 0.03, p = .67). The HT-NL correlated significantly with a test for emotion recognition (r = .45), and with measures of memory and language (r = [.31, .40]), but not with measures of information processing speed, executive functioning, or working memory (r = [.00, .17]). Preliminary normative data are provided. CONCLUSIONS: The HT-NL is a psychometrically sound and valid instrument and is useful for identifying Theory of Mind impairments in patients with dementia.

BackgroundScreening for cognitive function, using tests such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), is the first step in detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. However, the sensitivity of detecting MCI patients who will develop incident Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia in the near future is low.ObjectiveThis study aimed to clarify the utility of the combination of the MMSE and MoCA in selecting patients at a high risk of incident AD dementia.MethodsIn this post-hoc analysis, we derived data from a Japanese observational registry of patients with vascular risk factors. The primary outcome was incident AD dementia. The accepted cutoff values of an MMSE score of 28 and an MoCA score of 26 for MCI were considered.ResultsAfter excluding those who did not undergo the test, 940 patients were included. During a median follow-up period of 4.6 years, incident AD dementia occurred in 49 patients. Patients diagnosed with MCI with MMSE scores <28 or MoCA scores <26 showed a significantly higher risk of AD dementia than those with normal MMSE or MoCA groups. However, patients who met the MCI criteria in only one test showed a risk similar to that of the normal group. In contrast, patients who met the MCI criteria for MMSE and MoCA scores had a 20.65-fold higher risk than those with normal MMSE and MoCA scores.ConclusionsPatients who met the MCI criteria for both the MMSE and MoCA were highly susceptible to incident AD dementia.Clinical Trial RegistrationUMIN000026671.

OBJECTIVES: To conceptualize the concept of dementia friendly communities. METHODS: Walker and Avant's method of concept analysis was used to identify the concept, antecedents, attributes and consequences of dementia friendly communities. RESULTS: Four dimensions of dementia friendly communities' attributes were identified around target population, social life involvement, socio-cultural environment, living space and physical environment. Antecedents of dementia friendly communities were reduced physical and mental health, increased stigma and social isolation of people with dementia and caregivers, required dementia-supportive physical environment and mismatch between supply and demand of care resources. Consequences of dementia friendly communities were increased personal empowerment, reduced financial burden, promotion of dementia inclusion and healthy aging. CONCLUSION: The result of the analysis provided a clearer definition of dementia friendly communities, which can be further tested and used to develop guide future research and interventions.

OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are prevalent neurodegenerative diseases characterized by altered brain functional connectivity (FC), affecting over 100 million people worldwide. This study aims to identify distinct FC patterns as potential biomarkers for differential diagnosis. METHODS: Resting-state EEG data from 36 AD patients, 23 FTD patients, and 29 healthy controls were analyzed using time-frequency and bandpass filtering FC metrics. These metrics were estimated through Pearson's correlations, mutual information, and phase lag index, and served as input features in a support vector machine (SVM) with Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation for group classification. RESULTS: Both AD and FTD exhibited significantly decreased FC in the theta band within the frontal lobe and increased FC in the beta band in the posterior regions. Additionally, a decreased FC in central regions at theta band was observed uniquely in AD, but not in FTD. SVM classification accuracies reached 95% for AD and 86% for FTD. CONCLUSIONS: High classification accuracies underscore the potential of these FC alterations as reliable biomarkers for AD and FTD. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study to integrate time-frequency and bandpass filtering FC metrics to reveal brain network alterations in AD and FTD, providing new insights for diagnostics and neurodegenerative pathologies.

BackgroundA decline in driving skills is well documented in people with dementia.ObjectiveTo provide a current estimate and future forecast of drivers with dementia in Ontario, Canada, taking into account sex differences and longitudinal estimates of driving cessation in dementia.MethodsWe used historical provincial licensing data, population estimates and projections, as well as estimates of diagnosable dementia from the Landmark study of the Alzheimer's Society of Canada to create current estimates and forecasts of drivers with dementia in the province of Ontario, the most populous province of Canada, from 2024 to 2046. Sensitivity analyses were used to determine the impact of sex and assumptions regarding the rate of driving cessation.ResultsAssuming that an estimated 35% of people with diagnosable dementia stop driving very shortly after symptom onset followed by a more gradual decline over time, and that females stop driving twice as fast as men, we forecast approximately 154,000 drivers with dementia in the province of Ontario in 2046.ConclusionsAs dementia prevalence increases, our study provides a novel set of projections for drivers with dementia over the coming two decades, estimating a 221% to 226% increase. This work adds to the myriad of concerns about health and public services that will be needed to treat and support this population effectively, to detect early signs of dangerous driving among the cognitively impaired, and to provide alternative transportation options, once driving is no longer viable.

BACKGROUND: Non-Alzheimer's disease dementias, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD) can be difficult to characterize due to the predominance of distinct behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Widely used measurement tools lack structure and objectivity. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to use systematic direct observation of neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms, via the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale (NBRS), to characterize clusters of behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms in FTD and examine how selected symptom clusters correlate with structural neuroimaging. METHODS: We performed a factor analysis on the NBRS data from 172 patients with FTD and examined the neural correlates of the selected symptom clusters in a subsample of 67 patients. RESULTS: Six factors accounted for 56% of total variance across NBRS item scores: Apathy/Blunting, Agitation/Disinhibition, Cognitive/Language, Planning/Insight, Anxiety/Lability, and Psychosis. Symptom clusters showed significant associations with specific regions of cortical thinning: Agitation/Disinhibition with bilateral frontal regions, and Cognition/Language with the left bank of the superior temporal sulcus and supramarginal regions. CONCLUSIONS: The selected symptom clusters associated with known regions of atrophy in FTD. The NBRS is an effective observational measure that may extend characterization and understanding of FTD.

BackgroundHistopathological cholinergic pathways destruction is described in numerous neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer's disease [AD], dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB]). Detecting biological acetylcholine (ACh) deficits is however challenging due to its rapid post-mortem degradation and low concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our team collaborated in the development of a reliable liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technique for the measurement of ACh and choline (Ch) in CSF.ObjectiveOur study aimed to assess potential ACh concentration differences among patients by clinical diagnosis.MethodsThis monocentric cross-sectional study included patients with AD (n = 149), DLB (n = 20), and neurological controls (NC, n = 45) from the CHOLINE study (NCT03090854) or as additional controls (CSF from locoregional anesthesia). CSF samples were analyzed for ACh and Ch (LC-MS/MS), and acetylcholinesterase activity (enzymatic technique). Cholinergic markers were compared between groups using multivariate linear regression, adjusted for potential confounders (age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors).ResultsNo significant difference in ACh or Ch levels was found between diagnostic groups. A significant difference (p = 0.03) was observed for acetylcholinesterase activity, with a lower value in the DLB group versus the AD and NC groups.ConclusionsThe absence of intergroup ACh differences suggests CSF ACh is an unreliable diagnostic marker or indicator of cholinergic pathway damage. This could reflect a functional deficit or a dissociation between CSF and brain ACh levels. Larger studies are required to confirm our results and evaluate these markers for therapeutic target engagement of treatments designed to protect cholinergic pathways.

ObjectivesPeople with dementia often lose decisional capacity before death, underscoring the need for dementia-focused advance care planning (ACP) tools. In cooperation with our Community Advisory Board, we developed LEAD (Life-Planning in Early Alzheimer's and Other Dementias), a Web-based, self-guided, dementia-focused ACP intervention for care partners and persons with preclinical or mild dementia. This study evaluated the feasibility and initial efficacy of the LEAD intervention.MethodsCommunity-based dyads (N = 48) of one care recipient (person with or at risk for dementia) and one care partner completed the intervention and study surveys assessing decision-making self-efficacy, relationship quality, and medical advance directive completion. We utilized mixed-effects repeated measures models to explore changes in outcome variables over time in care recipients and care partners.ResultsSixty-four percent of dyads completed the intervention. There was a significant increase in decision-making self-efficacy scores among care recipients and care partners (P < .001) and a decrease in relationship strain among care partners (P < .05). There were no changes in positive relationship domains. Of the 23 dyads that did not have a completed medical advance directive prior to the study, 13 dyads (50.0%) completed this document during the intervention.DiscussionOur findings suggest the LEAD intervention is feasible and demonstrates initial efficacy in promoting dementia-focused ACP. The LEAD intervention has the potential to reduce relationship strain and help care partners improve their confidence as proxy decision-makers for people with dementia who cannot make independent medical decisions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are prevalent neurodegenerative disorders. Early diagnosis is challenging due to the lack of definitive biomarkers and reliance on invasive procedures. Immune biomarkers, particularly those reflecting the interaction between the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral immune system, have shown promise for non-invasive detection through blood samples. This study investigates the reactivity of serum IgM and IgG from AD and FTD patients against a library of mimotopes representing public IgM reactivities in healthy donors. Serum samples from AD, FTD, and other neurodegenerative dementias (ND) and controls were tested on peptide microarrays. The samples were pooled to mitigate individual variability. The reactivity data were analyzed using graphs to represent the cross-reactivity networks. The analysis revealed distinct reactivity patterns for the studied groups. Public IgM reactivities showed significant correlations with neurodegenerative conditions, with AD and FTD exhibiting loss or gain of specific IgM reactivities. Graph analysis highlighted significant differences between disease and control groups in graph density, clustering, and assortativity parameters. Mimotopes of IgM reactivities lost in dementia, particularly in AD, exhibited significant homology to HCDR3 sequences of human antibodies. Furthermore, clusters of reactivities showed significant distinctions between AD and FTD, with IgG reactivities providing additional differentiation. Several self-proteins related to neurodegeneration proved to have sequences homologous to disease-associated mimotopes. Interestingly, the beta-propeller signature sequence YWTD found in ApoE's receptor LRP1 proved a characteristic epitope for IgG in FTD but not AD. At the same time, the respective public gM mimotope YWTDSSR coincides with a highly conserved sequence in many microorganisms and sequences found in human HCDR3. Thus, the public IgM repertoire, characterized by its broad reactivity and inherent autoreactivity, offers valuable insights into the immunological alterations in neurodegenerative diseases. The study supports the potential of IgM and IgG reactivity profiles as another compartment of non-invasive biomarkers for early diagnosis and differentiating AD and FTD.

Dementia is becoming a serious social and healthcare issue worldwide. While recent studies suggest that timely intervention can prevent its progression, most patients with dementia remain undiagnosed. The low diagnosis rate is mainly caused by the lack of an efficient screening tool for dementia. The first step toward diagnosing dementia involves cognitive assessments with interview-based neuropsychological tests, which have a well-established clinical utility. Traditional neuropsychological tests have high validity and reliability for dementia testing; however, they have limitations such as high test-related burdens and inter-rater variability of the results. Digital technologies with artificial intelligence have transformed traditional cognitive tests into efficient tools for dementia screening. This review article introduces recent developments in the research on digital biomarkers for dementia and discusses their limitations in clinical settings.

INTRODUCTION: Lack of racial and ethnic minority representation in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) research studies leads to inaccurate trial results and health outcomes disparities. This study examines barriers to ADRD research participation in under-studied Filipino American participants and explores the potential of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI) to mitigate these barriers. METHODS: We utilized GIS mapping to analyze demographic differences across geographic distances from Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) in the United States. The number of visits in racial and ethnic minority populations was examined using regression analysis of participant data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). Surveys and interviews were conducted with researchers and participants from the University of California, San Francisco Memory and Aging Center to identify barriers and explore LF-MRI's potential to increase Filipino American participation. We conclude with recommendations for LF-MRI implementation in ADRD research. RESULTS: Location-based analysis demonstrates that LF-MRI may help diversify ADRD research participation by offering portable, cheap imaging modalities in satellite locations. Moreover, many racial and ethnic minority populations, particularly Asians, are underrepresented and less likely to have multiple ADRC visits compared to non-Hispanic and White individuals. Interviews and surveys identified participation barriers, including navigation, scheduling, fear of MRI, health-related stigma, and discomfort with conventional MRI procedures. It also suggested that LF-MRI may offer increased portability, reduced costs, improved physical comfort, and less anxiety. Additionally, researchers identified barriers to implementation, including lack of efficacy and reliability data for advanced imaging requirements, and logistical, privacy, and staff bandwidth concerns. DISCUSSION: These findings contribute to improved understanding of clinical research participation barriers among racial and ethnic minority populations. LF-MRI implementation was explored as a potential way to mitigate these barriers. Future research should address scientific and infrastructural limitations and explore ways to leverage the benefits of LF-MRI in advancing diversity in ADRD research. HIGHLIGHTS: Racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) research are underrepresented, including Asians.Expanding ADRD research access for Asian and minority groups needs broader outreach.Many minority populations are located beyond the typical travel distance from Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs).low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI) may address comfort, cost, accessibility, and geographical barriers.LF-MRI implementation may lead to an increase in research participation.

Vascular dementia (VaD) represents the second-most common dementia type after Alzheimer's disease since it results from complications of cerebrovascular disease. Mixed pathologies combining vascular and neurodegenerative processes are the rule rather than exception in elderly dementia patients. The condition known as VaD includes various types of vascular damage that affect both large and small blood vessels in the brain which results in cerebral hypoperfusion, blood-brain barrier disruption, glymphatic dysfunction, and molecular cascades causing neuronal damage. The mechanisms of VaD include endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, chronic neuroinflammation, impaired glymphatic clearance, white matter demyelination, and synaptic failure. The disease susceptibility of individuals depends on genetic factors which include NOTCH3 mutations and vascular risk polymorphisms. The diagnostic field uses neuroimaging tools and fluid biomarkers such as neurofilament light chain, inflammatory markers, and Aβ/tau ratios for mixed pathology. The current practice of vascular risk management combines with new therapeutic approaches that use phosphodiesterase inhibitors for cerebral perfusion and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors for neuroinflammation, senolytics for cellular senescence, and remyelination agents for white matter repair. However, the majority of new treatment methods remain investigational with limited Phase III data. Future medical treatment development will depend on precision medicine approaches which use biomarker-guided treatment selection and combination strategies targeting multiple pathological mechanisms.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Empathy comprises cognitive and emotional components. However, the impairments in empathy among individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) are not well understood, particularly in the context of depression, which may exacerbate these deficits. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of neurodegeneration and depression on empathetic abilities. METHODS: The study included 31 healthy elderly (HE) individuals, 30 patients with amnestic multi-domain MCI (amMCI), and 30 patients with DAT. Empathy was assessed using the Korean-Multifaceted Empathy Test (K-MET), and the Interpersonal Response Index (IRI). Participants were classified as depressed or non-depressed using the Geriatric Depression Scale. A two-way MANOVA was conducted to examine differences in empathy based on group and depressive status. RESULTS: A significant interaction between group and depressive status was found for both cognitive and emotional empathy on the K-MET, but not on the IRI. In the depressed group, cognitive empathy scores were lower in the order of HE, amMCI, and DAT. Similarly, in the non-depressed group, the HE group performed better than both amMCI and DAT, with no significant difference between the latter two. Regarding emotional empathy, the depressed HE group scored higher than both amMCI and DAT, with no significant difference between these groups. In the non-depressed group, emotional empathy declined in the order of HE, amMCI, and DAT. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that both neurodegeneration and depression significantly impair empathetic abilities, with declines in cognitive and emotional empathy evident at the MCI stage, regardless of depressive status.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to explore the association between plasma amyloid-β oligomerization tendency (OAβ) and cognitive performance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and determine its predictive value for outcomes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Plasma from 727 subjects (286 AD, 260 MCI, and 181 controls) in a case registry was analyzed using the multimer detection system (MDS) to measure plasma OAβ. RESULTS: Elevated plasma OAβ was strongly correlated with multidomain cognitive performance in patients with MCI and AD. Patients with MCI with high baseline plasma OAβ demonstrated a higher risk of progressing to dementia (hazard ratio = 1.083, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.032-1.137). Baseline plasma OAβ effectively predicted MCI-dementia conversion (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.824, 95% CI 0.752-0.897). DISCUSSION: The real-world findings underscore the clinical relevance of plasma OAβ as a potential predictor for the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: We recruit study participants of Alzheimer's dementia (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal controls in a case registry.We use the multimer detection system (MDS) to measure plasma amyloid-β oligomerization tendency (OAβ).We observe that elevated plasma OAβ strongly correlates with multidomain cognitive performance in patients with MCI and AD.MCI individuals with high baseline plasma OAβ demonstrate a higher risk of progressing to dementia.The real-world findings underscore the clinical relevance of plasma Oaβ as a potential predictor for the conversion from MCI to dementia.

BACKGROUND: Apathy is almost ubiquitous across neurodegenerative diseases and can be a general model for understanding neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia. METHODS: We assessed apathy via Starkstein's Apathy Scale-caregiver version (SAS-C) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Neuropsychological and structural neuroimaging data were also collected. Images were processed using the FreeSurfer program, and cortical thickness data were acquired for 68 brain regions. RESULTS: Patients with bvFTD had statistically higher levels of apathy than those with AD. The multivariate linear regression model found that the left entorhinal cortex (lEC) was the only region statistically associated with apathy in the AD group (F(1,31) = 5.17; p = 0.030; R2 = 0.527), whereas, for bvFTD, the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex achieved significant association with apathy (F(1,30) = 5.69; p = 0.009; R2 = 0.804). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that apathy is associated with multiple brain regions, reinforcing its multidimensionality and specific profiles.

OBJECTIVE: Dementia is a neurocognitive disorder characterized by memory loss and deficits in multiple cognitive domains, caused by damage to or loss of neurons in the brain, which impairs one's abilities and capabilities for independent daily living. The etiologies of dementia are diverse, including vascular, infectious, traumatic, and neurodegenerative causes. The most common types of dementia include Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Patients with dementia frequently develop cognitive, psycho-behavioral, emotional, and mood symptoms. One largely unstudied mood symptom seen in dementia patients is pseudobulbar affect (PBA). PBA is a state of emotional incontinence characterized by episodes of uncontrolled crying or laughter that are inconsistent with the social context or the patient's emotional state. Although many neurological disorders may present with PBA, only a small fraction of the literature focuses on PBA in dementia patients. In the present study, we used the TriNetX database to identify a cohort of patients with both PBA and dementia. We describe this cohort to provide a foundation for further research on this patient population. RESULTS: Seventy-three percent (n=182) of the cohort had postconcussion syndrome, 18% (n=44) had overt dementia, 49% (n=121) had mild cognitive impairment, and 42% (n=105) had some form of amnesia. Many patients had comorbid psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depressive disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The multitude of comorbid mood disorders and symptoms can complicate the clinical management of dementia patients, adding to their distress and that of their caregivers. Understanding these symptoms is essential for providing an accurate diagnosis and effective management of PBA in dementia.

BackgroundCardio and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementia (ADRD) significantly impact older adult populations, with interlinked pathways influencing risk and progression. In Hawaii, where over 20% of the population is 65 or older and ethnic diversity is among the highest in the U.S., the relationship between ADRD and CVD requires closer examination, especially concerning racial and socioeconomic factors.ObjectiveThis study aims to assess the effects of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status on the bidirectional risk pathways between ADRD and CVD among older populations in Hawaii.MethodsUtilizing a multistate modeling framework, we analyzed nine years of longitudinal Medicare data to track transitions between ADRD, CVD, and mortality outcomes. We investigated associations among racial and ethnic groups, including Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander (NHPI), Asian Americans (AA) and white populations, accounting for socioeconomic status to identify disparities in risk progression and outcomes.ResultsThe analysis revealed notable racial and socioeconomic disparities in the transitions between ADRD, heart disease (HD), Stroke, and mortality among Hawaii's older population. Overall, lower socioeconomic status indicates increased risks for transitioning to more severe clinical states and mortality. However, such effects were found to be varied among races: AA, NHPI, and whites. Our findings suggest that socioeconomic status modifies the ADRD, HD, Stroke progression dynamics across different ethnicities.ConclusionsThis study highlights the significant role of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status in the complex progression of ADRD and CVD.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Research has established that unpaid family members, friends, or others who care for persons with dementia (ie, caregivers) may encounter socioemotional and physical health concerns as a consequence of providing extensive assistance. Similarly, caregivers for people living with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often experience a range of stressors and negative mental health outcomes due to care demands. Individuals with TBI often develop Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementia (AD/ADRD). This history of TBI may introduce complications to AD/ADRD caregiving. A comprehensive intervention grounded in the understanding of the complex caregiving context of both diagnoses is warranted to address the unique needs and concerns of TBI-AD/ADRD caregivers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study evaluated the feasibility of the TBI-AD/ADRD Caregiver Support Intervention (TACSI) psychoeducational program, designed to support the unique subset of caregivers facing the challenge of assisting relatives with AD/ADRD and a history of TBI. TACSI, a 6-session telehealth intervention, provides tailored psychosocial and psychoeducational coaching. In partnership with the 2 national healthcare centers, 15 caregivers enrolled in the 3-month feasibility study evaluating the design and subsequent refinement of TACSI. Mixed methods data were collected from 3-month follow-up surveys and qualitative data from postintervention interviews. RESULTS: The feasibility, utility, and acceptance of TACSI were established. Caregivers liked the telehealth delivery and the personalized nature of TACSI, yet some expressed it would have been more beneficial earlier in their caregiving journey. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Caregivers valued the TACSI program. Their feedback has been applied to improve TACSI content and delivery for a larger pilot randomized controlled trial that is currently underway.

Objective: Blood-based biomarkers are valued for their lower cost and less invasive nature, though issues with widespread implementation and accessibility remain. Process-based scores from story recall have been shown to detect neuronal network disturbances typical of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology more effectively than traditional metrics. This study examined the associations between process-based scores and concurrent plasma AD biomarkers in older adults without dementia, while also comparing them to traditional metrics. Additionally, it also investigated the diagnostic utility of these metrics in detecting plasma p-tau217 positivity. Methods: Data from 416 participants (mean age = 66.6 ± 7) free of dementia were extracted from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP). Logical Memory Test (LMT) and plasma p-tau217, p-tau181, p-tau231, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, GFAP and NfL levels were analyzed. Bayesian regression models assessed associations between plasma biomarkers and both process-based and traditional LMT scores, controlling for the covariates. Results: The best-fitting model for plasma p-tau217 included Total ratio (Tr) and Immediate recall (BF10=573), but Tr showed stronger evidence of association (mean coefficient = 0.208; BFinclusion=14.4) than Immediate recall (mean coefficient=-0.007; BFinclusion=1.7). Tr was also the best predictor of plasma p-tau181 (mean coefficient = 0.144; BF10=10.5) and GFAP (mean coefficient = 0.141; BF10=5.8), outperforming traditional LMT scores. No memory scores were associated with plasma p-tau231 or Aβ42/40 ratio levels. Tr score was the strongest single predictor of p-tau217 positivity (BF(10)=38). Conclusions: These findings suggest that process-based memory scores might be useful in enhancing the detection of neuronal network disturbances associated with AD pathology, especially in settings where biomarker testing is unavailable.

INTRODUCTION: Timely diagnosis is crucial for managing neurodegenerative conditions. This study investigated whether time from symptom onset to diagnosis differs by clinical syndrome and sex. METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional study included 591 participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) subtypes (behavioral variant FTD [bvFTD], semantic dementia [SD], and progressive non-fluent aphasia), logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA), and syndromes associated with movement disorders (corticobasal syndrome, FTD with motor neuron disease [FTD-MND], and progressive supranuclear palsy). Bayesian regression models were used to compute diagnostic timelines. RESULTS: Compared to AD (3.35 years; 95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.03-3.72), SD and bvFTD had additional delays of 9.7 (95% CrI: 1.96-20.64) and 14.82 months (95% CrI: 6.94-25.42), respectively, while FTD-MND was shorter by 11.62 months (95% CrI: -15.7 to -4.68). Men with bvFTD had 23.64 month longer delays than women (95% CrI: 10.35-44.33). DISCUSSION: Diagnostic delays may reflect syndrome-specific clinical features, diagnostic complexity, and sociocultural factors. Findings highlight the need for improved diagnostic pathways and pre-clinical biomarkers to facilitate earlier identification. HIGHLIGHTS: Bayesian analyses revealed that diagnostic delays differ by syndrome and sex.Alzheimer's disease (AD) was diagnosed on average 3.35 years after symptom onset.Diagnoses were delayed in semantic and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) compared to AD.Men with bvFTD had longer delays than women.Findings support need for improved diagnostic pathways and pre-clinical biomarkers.

Dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder characterized by various cognitive and behavioral decline factors. In this work, we propose an extension of the traditional k-means clustering for multivariate time series data to cluster joint trajectories of different features describing progression over time. The algorithm we propose here enables the joint analysis of various longitudinal features to explore co-occurring trajectory factors among markers indicative of cognitive decline in individuals participating in an AD progression study. By examining how multiple variables co-vary and evolve together, we identify distinct subgroups within the cohort based on their longitudinal trajectories. Our clustering method enhances the understanding of individual development across multiple dimensions and provides deeper medical insights into the trajectories of cognitive decline. In addition, the proposed algorithm is also able to make a selection of the most significant features in separating clusters by considering trajectories over time. This process, together with a preliminary pre-processing on the OASIS-3 dataset, reveals an important role of some neuropsychological factors. In particular, the proposed method has identified a significant profile compatible with a syndrome known as Mild Behavioral Impairment (MBI), displaying behavioral manifestations of individuals that may precede the cognitive symptoms typically observed in AD patients. The findings underscore the importance of considering multiple longitudinal features in clinical modeling, ultimately supporting more effective and individualized patient management strategies.

IMPORTANCE: Previous studies have described a potential association between epilepsy and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but no systematic data are available. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether epilepsy is more prevalent in patients with FTD than in healthy controls (HCs) or patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this case-control study, we compared the prevalence of epilepsy and purchases of antiseizure medicines (ASMs) among patients with FTD, matched HCs, and patients with AD from 2 early-onset dementia diagnostics centers in the same geographic regions of Finland. AD or FTD diagnoses were made between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2021. Data were analyzed from January 26, 2024, to January 16, 2025. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was to describe the prevalence of epilepsy in patients with FTD, covering the time period from 10 years before to 5 years after the FTD diagnosis. We used International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes to identify all patients with epilepsy and tracked purchases of ASMs. RESULTS: The study cohort included 245 patients with FTD (121 female [49.4%], 124 male [50.6%]; mean [SD] age, 65.2 [8.7] years), 2416 matched HCs (1190 female [49.3%], 1226 male [50.7%]; mean [SD] age, 65.0 [8.5] years), and 1326 patients with AD (777 female [58.6%], 549 male [41.4%]; mean [SD] age, 71.7 [9.8] years). The prevalence of epilepsy was higher in the FTD group compared with the HC group (3.3% vs 0.8%, respectively; P = .002) and AD group (3.3% vs 1.4%, respectively; P = .01) 10 years before FTD diagnosis. At the year of the diagnosis, the prevalence was 6.5% in patients with FTD, 1.8% in HCs (FTD vs HC difference, 4.7 percentage points [ppt] [95% CI, 2.2-8.6 ppt]; P < .001), and 5.0% in patients with AD (FTD vs AD difference, 1.6 ppt [95% CI, -1.2 to 5.5 ppt]; P = .32); at 5 years after the diagnosis, the prevalence was 11.2% in patients with FTD, 2.2% in HCs (FTD vs HC difference, 9.0 ppt [95% CI, 5.0-14.6 ppt]; P < .001), and 6.9% in patients with AD (FTD vs AD difference, 4.2 ppt [95% CI, 0-10.0 ppt]; P = .05). ASM purchases were made significantly more often among patients with FTD (10.2%) compared with HCs (1.8%) and patients with AD (4.2%) (FTD vs HC difference, 8.4 ppt [95% CI, 5.2-12.9 ppt]; P < .001; FTD vs AD difference, 6.1 ppt [95% CI, 2.6-10.6 ppt]; P < .001) at all time points and increased during the study period. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This case-control study found a higher prevalence of epilepsy and increased ASM use among patients with FTD compared with HCs and patients with AD , suggesting an association between epileptic abnormalities and the pathophysiology of FTD. Further studies are warranted to investigate a potential overlap in the pathophysiologic mechanisms of epilepsy and FTD.

The eligibility criteria for social pension schemes in Africa hinder equitable and healthy aging. In 2019, women in 14 sub-Saharan African countries had an average life expectancy of 67 years but a healthy life expectancy of only 57 years, leaving them 5 years in poor health before receiving a pension at age 62. Men had a similar situation-a life expectancy of 62 years and a healthy life expectancy of 53 years, spending 10 years in poor health before becoming eligible for pensions at age 63. Many men do not receive pensions due to early death. Delays and low pension payouts contribute to a 2.5% increase in the death rate from Alzheimer's disease and dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: Eligibility criteria for social pension schemes in Africa hinder equitable and healthy aging. Delays and low pension payouts are associated with worsening death rates from dementia. Average health life expectancy for both genders should serve as a basis for initiating pension payouts.

OBJECTIVE: While Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) show some common memory deficits, these two disorders show partially overlapping complex spatiotemporal patterns of neural dynamics. The objective of this study is to characterize these patterns to better understand the general principles of neurodynamics in these conditions. METHODS: A comprehensive array of methods to study brain rhythms and functional brain networks are used in the study, from spectral power measures to Lyapunov exponent, phase synchronization, temporal synchrony patterns, and measures of the functional brain connectivity. Furthermore, machine learning techniques for classification are used to augment the methodology. RESULTS: Multiple measures (spectral, synchrony, functional network organization) indicate an array of differences between neurodynamics of AD and FTD, and control subjects across different frequency bands. CONCLUSIONS: These differences taken together in an integrative way suggest that AD neural activity may be less coordinated and less connected across areas, and more random, while FTD shows more coordinated neural activity (except slow frontal activity). SIGNIFICANCE: AD and FTD may represent opposite changes from normal brain function in terms of the spatiotemporal coordination of neural activity. Deviations from normal in both directions may lead to neurological deficits, which are specific to each of the disorders.

AIM: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia, marked by cognitive decline and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Early differentiation between AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (HC) is essential for improving diagnostic accuracy and guiding effective treatment strategies. METHODS: This retrospective study included 120 participants divided into AD (n = 40), MCI (n = 40), and HC (n = 40) groups. Brain MRI data were analyzed using the AccuBrain system to quantify AD Resemblance Atrophy Index (AD-RAI), Quantitative Medial Temporal Atrophy (QMTA), hippocampal volume, and white matter hyperintensities. Correlation analyses were conducted between imaging biomarkers and cognitive function scores (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE; Neuropsychiatric Inventory, NPI). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluated the diagnostic performance of the biomarkers. RESULTS: AD patients had significantly higher AD-RAI (0.91 ± 0.25) and more pronounced hippocampal atrophy (0.36 ± 0.09) compared to MCI and HC (P < 0.001). Correlation analyses showed that AD-RAI and QMTA were negatively correlated with MMSE scores (r = -0.718, P < 0.001; r = -0.463, P < 0.001), while hippocampal volume was positively correlated with MMSE (r = 0.408, P < 0.001). ROC analysis revealed that AD-RAI had an AUC of 0.777 for distinguishing AD from MCI, while QMTA had an AUC of 0.938 for distinguishing AD from HC. BPSD patients exhibited higher AD-RAI (1.09 ± 0.18) and greater hippocampal atrophy, with ROC AUC > 0.9 for distinguishing BPSD from non-BPSD patients. CONCLUSION: The AccuBrain MRI system demonstrated high sensitivity and diagnostic value in distinguishing AD from MCI and HC, as well as in identifying patients with BPSD. Correlation and ROC analyses support the use of these imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies in AD.

BACKGROUND: The predicted prevalence of people with dementia (PWD) in Germany has risen to 1.8 million since 2010. In the near future, we will see the approval of antibody therapies. The study aims to demonstrate the recent anti-dementia medication prescriptions and diagnosis prevalence. METHODS: Data from 357 general practitioner (GP) and 71 specialist practices (SP) (1.1 Mio. patients) were analyzed to demonstrate the prevalence of dementia diagnoses and anti-dementia drug prescriptions between 2010 and 2021. RESULTS: The diagnosis prevalence of PWD (Alzheimer's dementia) remained relatively constant in GP practices at 1.0-1.3% (0.19-0.21%). Among SP, the prevalence increased from 4.9% (2.8%) to 5.9% (3.6%). The anti-dementia prescription rate decreased in GP (from 0.14% to 0.10%) and increased in SP practices (from 2.1% to 2.4%). DISCUSSION: The diagnosis and prescription rate, especially in GP practices, remained below the prevalence forecasts and the expected prescriptions.

BACKGROUND: Agitation is a common neuropsychiatric symptom of Alzheimer's dementia. Limited qualitative evidence is available to characterize the clinical meaningfulness of changes in agitation behaviors, as assessed by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). OBJECTIVE: To collect qualitative data to characterize the magnitude of change in CMAI scores required to represent a clinically meaningful improvement in agitation behaviors from the perspectives of physicians and professional caregivers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-on-one qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 physicians treating Alzheimer's dementia and 15 professional caregivers. Nine patient vignettes depicting observed changes in CMAI score profiles over a 12-week study period were used as examples of different magnitudes of change in the CMAI total score. RESULTS: The proportion of participants affirming clinical meaningfulness varied for both physicians and caregivers within and across the nine vignettes presented; however, the four vignettes corresponding to a CMAI total score reduction of 14 or greater were considered clinically meaningful to all participants. Most physicians (8/13) and caregivers (7/13) found a total score reduction of 5 to be clinically meaningful, and some participants (2 caregivers; 0 physicians) articulated that even minimal changes could be clinically meaningful depending on the type of behavior. CONCLUSION: Participants who regularly treat people with Alzheimer's dementia described a significant burden associated with agitation behaviors and provided qualitative examples highlighting that even minor reductions in the frequency of such behaviors can have meaningful benefits for the patient's care and the burden on professional caregivers and family members.

In 2020, the Lancet Commission identified 12 modifiable factors that increase population-level dementia risk. It is unclear if these risk factors co-occur among individuals in a clinically meaningful way. Using latent class analysis, we identified profiles of modifiable dementia risk factors in dementia-free adults aged 60-64 years from the UK Biobank. We then estimated associations between these profiles with incident dementia, cognition, and neuroimaging outcomes, and explored the differences across profiles in the effects of a polygenic risk score for Alzheimer's disease on outcomes. In 55,333 males and 63,063 females, three sex-specific latent profiles were identified: cardiometabolic risk, substance use-related risk, and low risk. The cardiometabolic risk profile in both males and females was associated with greater incidence of all-cause dementia (male: OR [95% CI] = 2.33 [2.03, 2.66]; female: OR [95% CI] = 1.44 [1.24, 1.68]), poorer cognitive performance, greater brain atrophy, and greater white matter hyperintensity volume compared to the low risk profile. The substance use-related risk profile in males was associated with poorer cognitive performance and greater white matter hyperintensities compared to the low risk profile, but no difference in all-cause dementia incidence was observed (OR [95% CI] = 1.00 [0.95, 1.06]). In females, the substance use-related risk profile demonstrated increased dementia incidence (OR [95% CI] = 1.58 [1.57, 1.58]) and greater brain atrophy but smaller white matter hyperintensity volume compared to the low risk profile. The polygenic risk score had larger effects among females, and differentially influenced outcomes across profiles; for instance, there were larger effects of the polygenic risk score on atrophy in the cardiometabolic profile vs. the low risk profile among males, and larger effects of the polygenic risk score on loss of white matter integrity in the cardiometabolic profile vs. the low risk profile among females. These results reveal three modifiable dementia risk profiles, their unique cognitive/neuroimaging outcomes, and their interactions with genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease. These differences highlight the need to consider population heterogeneity in risk prediction tools and in planning personalized prevention strategies.

Dementia is a syndrome of impaired brain function in which cognitive functions such as memory, language, attention, direction, and judgment are impaired, affecting or interfering with daily functioning. As dementia becomes more widespread, it is crucial to investigate the underlying mechanisms that contribute to cognitive decline. C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) has been extensively researched for its role in immune responses and function as a co-receptor in HIV infection. Current research indicates that CCR5, which acts as a regulator of synaptic plasticity, is involved in modulating various forms of learning and memory. Most studies suggest that CCR5 generally has a detrimental effect on diseases associated with dementia. This review seeks to deliver an extensive analysis of CCR5's role in cognitive processes by summarizing existing literature from both animal and human studies. It will cover the involvement of CCR5 in standard learning and memory functions, as well as in various types of dementia. The review will specifically address conditions such as HIV-related neurocognitive impairment (HAND), Alzheimer's disease (AD), stroke, vascular dementia, multiple sclerosis (MS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). Based on the fact that CCR5 plays a contributing role in many diseases that cause dementia, this review also proposed CCR5 inhibition as a possible target for alleviating and ameliorating dementia.

BACKGROUND: Family care partners of persons living with dementia (PLWD) have limited support and resources and experience high levels of stress and burden. Prior research has demonstrated that one call to the Alzheimer's Association's Helpline benefitted 80% of callers following a single call. However, some care partners need more support than a single call. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of offering up to two additional Helpline care consultations after an initial call to the Helpline. METHODS: 2503 study participants were Helpline callers who received one, two, or three care consultations at the callers' request. The PROMIS measure of self-efficacy in managing emotions was assessed among participants over time (baseline to two weeks after each care consultation), and differences were assessed between caller groups. RESULTS: No statistical differences were noted in demographics between those who received a single call versus two or three calls. Baseline self-efficacy scores were significantly lower in those who requested more than one call (p < 0.01). Self-efficacy scores improved over time in all three groups of callers, and the improvement was significant in those who received one and two care consultations (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Further research is indicated to understand the specific support needs of care partners that can benefit from more than one call to a telesupport helpline.

OBJECTIVE: To meet the growing demand for timely diagnosis in the new era of disease-modifying medications for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the present study aimed to reduce clinic wait times by developing and refining an abbreviated neuropsychological battery to assess individuals with a suspected amnestic process (i.e., Early-Stage AD Pathway). METHOD: Early-Stage AD Pathway patients were referred by an internal neurology provider who determined that the patient had: (1) an amnestic clinical presentation, (2) a normal neurological examination, and (3) a Montreal Cognitive Assessment total score between 18 and 25. These patients were scheduled for a 2-h neuropsychological evaluation, including a brief clinical interview and an abbreviated testing battery. We evaluated n = 19 patients in the Early-Stage AD Pathway and compared them to 114 older adults referred via traditional clinic procedures (i.e., General Clinic). RESULTS: Most individuals evaluated via the Early-Stage AD Pathway were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; 68.4%) or mild dementia (21.1%) through the neuropsychological evaluation. Rate of diagnosis of MCI/dementia was comparable between groups. The average number of days between initial referral and completion of the neuropsychological evaluation was significantly lower (Mdiff = 145.8 days, U = 1867.500, p < 0.001) for the Early-Stage AD Pathway group than for the General Clinic group, as the former could be scheduled more flexibly. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing an abbreviated neuropsychological assessment process significantly reduced the time between referral and evaluation to identify individuals who may be eligible for emerging pharmacological treatments for AD and/or non-pharmacological interventions in a timely manner.

BackgroundDementia is a global public health challenge, with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) being the most prevalent subtypes. Air pollution is a potential risk factor for dementia, but few studies separate AD and VaD.ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate whether exposure to air pollution is associated with the incidence of AD and VaD.MethodsThis study involved 30,247 participants from the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (1991-2014), with 1216 AD cases (including mixed type) and 531 VaD cases, clinically validated. Long-term exposure to PM(2.5) and NO(x) was modeled using the past 5-years or 10-year mean concentration with 50m × 50 m spatial resolution at residential addresses. The association between AD and VaD and air pollution was assessed using adjusted Cox-proportional hazards.ResultsFor AD the hazard ratios (HRs (95% CIs) were 1.06 (0.89-1.27) for PM(2.5) and 1.08 (0.96-1.22) for NO(x) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in past 10-year mean pollution-levels. Nonsignificant associations were observed in two-pollutant models. For past 5-year exposure, we observed a statistically significant association between NO(x) and AD 1.14 (1.00-1.30). For VaD, we found no evidence for associations in any models.ConclusionsWe found that while both PM(2.5) and NO(x) seemed linked to increased AD risk in single-pollutant models, only the associations with NO(x) remained in two-pollutant models, particularly for exposures in the past five years. No associations were observed for VaD. The results underscore the importance of distinguishing dementia subtypes, identifying critical exposure windows, and applying multi-pollutant models in future studies.

Seizures in people with dementia (PWD) are associated with faster cognitive decline and worse clinical outcomes. However, the relationship between ongoing seizure activity and post-mortem neuropathology in PWD remains unexplored. We compared post-mortem findings in PWD with active, remote and no seizures using multicentre data from 39 Alzheimer's Disease Research Centres from 2005 to 2021. PWD were grouped by seizure status into active (seizures over the preceding 1 year), remote (prior seizures but none in the preceding 1 year) and no seizures (controls). Baseline demographics, cognition, mortality and post-mortem findings of primary and contributing (co-pathologies) Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Lewy body, vascular pathologies and neurodegeneration were compared among the groups using Pearson's χ2 test, Fisher's exact test, t-test and ANOVA. Of 10 474 deceased PWD, active seizure participants suffered the highest mortality among the groups (proportion deceased among the groups: active = 56%, remote = 35%, controls = 34%, P < 0.001). Among 6085 (58.1% of deceased) who underwent autopsy, 294 had active, 151 had remote and 5640 had no seizures. PWD and active seizures died at a younger age (active = 75.8, remote = 77.9, controls = 80.8 years, P < 0.001) and had more severe dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating score: active = 2.36, remote = 1.90, controls = 1.69, P < 0.001). In post hoc analyses, those with primary post-mortem diagnosis of AD with active seizures had more severe and later stages of AD pathology and ATN (amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration), as evidenced by Braak stage for neurofibrillary (tau) degeneration and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) score density of neuritic (amyloid) plaques, than remote seizure participants and controls. Active seizure participants had more neurodegeneration, evidenced by cerebral atrophy, hippocampal atrophy and locus coeruleus hypopigmentation, than controls. Among participants with primary post-mortem diagnosis of non-AD, in post hoc analyses, active seizure participants had worse AD co-pathology, evidenced by higher Braak stages than remote seizures and controls and a higher Thal phase of beta-amyloid plaques than remote seizure participants. Neurodegeneration (cerebral/hippocampal atrophy) and locus coeruleus hypopigmentation were comparable among the groups. In both primary post-mortem AD and non-AD diagnoses, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (co)pathology was less prevalent among active seizure participants than controls, while vascular pathology, Circle of Willis atherosclerosis, Lewy body pathology, lobar atrophy and substantia nigra hypopigmentation were comparable among the three groups. This study shows that active seizures, compared with remote seizures, are associated with earlier death and post-mortem evidence of more severe ATN pathology. Active seizures are associated with more advanced AD pathology in AD and worse AD co-pathology in non-AD dementias. Therefore, clinicians should be vigilant in detecting ongoing seizures, because this could reflect a worse prognosis in PWD.

BackgroundResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have described connectivity alterations in large-scale brain networks. However, little is known about functional changes across disease stages, particularly in DLB.ObjectiveTo investigate functional connectivity of key brain networks in DLB patients at different stages, compare them to AD patients and healthy controls (HC), and examine associations with core clinical symptoms.MethodsNinety DLB patients (63 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI-DLB] and 27 with dementia [d-DLB]), 25 AD patients (11 MCI-AD and 14 d-AD) and 34 HC underwent clinical, neuropsychological and resting-state fMRI assessments. Region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI analyses were performed using the CONN toolbox (p(FDR) < 0.05).ResultsThe overall DLB group showed reduced functional connectivity within the salience network (SN) compared to HC, but not to the overall AD group. At the subgroup level, d-DLB patients showed reduced SN and frontoparietal network (FPN) connectivity compared to both HC and the overall AD group, whereas MCI-DLB did not significantly differ from either group. In the overall DLB group, SN connectivity correlated with fluctuation severity and FPN connectivity correlated with both REM sleep behavior disorder and cognitive decline. In the overall AD group, decreased default mode network (DMN) connectivity was associated with lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores.ConclusionsSN and FPN connectivity impairments relate to disease progression and core clinical features in DLB, whereas DMN connectivity is linked to cognitive decline in AD. These distinct patterns highlight divergent paths of network dysfunction in the two diseases.Clinical Trial: This study is part of the AlphaLewyMA cohort, registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT01876459; registered on June 12, 2013).

Background: Phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks are cognitive measures that engage both executive functioning and language. Objective: Exploring the prevalence of phonemic and semantic advantages (PAs; SAs) in patients with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and behavioral variant-frontotemporal dementia (ADD; bvFTD) by means of the Fluency Type Index (FTI), and to examine, in these populations, its association with clinical variables. Methods: ADD (N = 113) and bvFTD (N = 38) patients and healthy controls (HCs, N = 87), were administered phonemic and semantic fluency tests. The FTI was computed using demographically adjusted scores as follows: SVF-PVF/SVF + PVF. Negative values suggest a PA and positive ones suggest a SA. Bidirectional tolerance limits were computed on HCs' FTI values to set the thresholds for defining both a PA and a SA. In patients, correlational analyses were run to test the association between FTI values and disease duration (in months) and severity (i.e., Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE). Results: In the ADD cohort, an almost equal number of patients displayed a PA (11%) and a SA (10%). In the bvFTD group, 11% of patients presented with a SA, while a PA was less frequent (5%). FTI classification distributions did not differ between these two groups (p = 0.615). In ADD patients, but not in bvFTD ones, the FTI was negatively related to disease duration (p = 0.009). No associations were detected with the MMSE. Conclusions: Both PAs and SAs might be common to both ADD and bvFTD patients; however, in ADD patients, PAs might reflect a longer disease duration and a more severe cognitive involvement.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the capacity of neuropsychological assessment to predict the regional brain metabolism in a cohort of patients with amnestic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) using Machine Learning algorithms. METHODS: We included 360 subjects, consisting of 186 patients with AD, 87 with bvFTD, and 87 cognitively healthy controls. All participants underwent a neuropsychological assessment using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination and the Neuronorma battery, in addition to [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging. We trained Machine Learning algorithms, including artificial neural networks (ANN) and models that incorporate genetic algorithms (GAs), to predict the presence of regional hypometabolism in FDG-PET imaging based on cognitive testing results. RESULTS: The proposed models demonstrated the ability to predict hypometabolism trends with approximately 70% accuracy in key regions associated with AD and bvFTD. In addition, we showed that incorporating neuropsychological tests provided relevant information for predicting brain hypometabolism. The temporal lobe was the best-predicted region, followed by the parietal, frontal, and some areas in the occipital lobe. Diagnosis played a significant role in the estimation of hypometabolism, and several neuropsychological tests were identified as the most important predictors for different brain regions. In our experiments, classical Machine Learning models, such as support vector machines enhanced by a preliminary feature selection step using GAs outperformed ANNs. CONCLUSIONS: A successful prediction of regional brain metabolism of patients with AD and bvFTD was achieved based on the results of neuropsychological examination and Machine Learning algorithms. These findings support the neurobiological validity of neuropsychological examination and the feasibility of a topographical diagnosis in patients with neurodegenerative disorders.

Sleep-waking is regulated by numerous sleep- and wake-promoting nuclei in the brain and biological clocks (suprachiasmatic nucleus). In dementia, organic damage occurs in the brainstem, hypothalamus, and thalamus, where these nuclei and their neural projections are concentrated, resulting in severe insomnia, hypersomnia, and irregular sleep-wake patterns. Numerous cohort studies have strongly suggested that sleep disturbances, such as impaired sleep quality and hypersomnia, may serve as early indicators or risk factors for the onset of dementia. Until recently, the neuropathological mechanisms underlying the association between sleep disturbance and the risk of dementia remained unclear. However, recent advances in research on the glymphatic system and its association with amyloid-beta peptide clearance have begun to elucidate this missing link.

People with semantic dementia (SD) or semantic variant primary progressive aphasia typically present with marked atrophy of the anterior temporal lobe, and thereafter progress more slowly than other forms of frontotemporal dementia. This suggests a prolonged prodromal phase with accumulation of neuropathology and minimal symptoms, about which little is known. To study early and presymptomatic SD, we first examine a well-characterised cohort of people with SD recruited from the Cambridge Centre for Frontotemporal Dementia. Five people with early SD had coincidental MRI prior to the onset of symptoms, or were healthy volunteers in research with anterior temporal lobe atrophy as an incidental finding. We model longitudinal imaging changes in left- and right-lateralised SD to predict atrophy at symptom onset. We then assess 61,203 participants with structural brain MRI in the UK Biobank to find individuals with imaging changes in keeping with SD but with no neurodegenerative diagnosis. To identify these individuals in UK Biobank, we design an ensemble-based classifier, differentiating baseline structural MRI in SD from healthy controls and patients with other neurodegenerative diseases, including other causes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. We train the classifier on a Cambridge-based cohort (SD n=47, other neurodegenerative diseases n=498, healthy controls n=88) and test it on a combined cohort from the Neuroimaging in Frontotemporal Dementia study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (SD n=42, other neurodegenerative n=449, healthy control n=127). From our case series, we find people with marked atrophy three to five years before recognition of symptom onset in left- or right-predominant SD. We present right-lateralised cases with subtle multimodal semantic impairment, found concurrently with only mild behavioural disturbance. We show that imaging measures can be used to reliably and accurately differentiate clinical SD from other neurodegenerative diseases (recall 0.88, precision 0.95, F1 score 0.91). We find individuals with no neurodegenerative diagnosis in the UK Biobank with striking left-lateralised (prevalence ages 45-85 4.8/100,000) or right-lateralised (5.9/100,000) anterior temporal lobe atrophy, with deficits on cognitive testing suggestive of semantic impairment. These individuals show progressive involvement of other cognitive domains in longitudinal follow-up. Together, our findings suggest that (i) there is a burden of incipient early anterior temporal lobe atrophy in older populations, with comparable prevalence of left- and right-sided cases from this prospective unbiased approach to identification, (ii) substantial atrophy is required for manifest symptoms, particularly in right-lateralised cases, and (iii) semantic deficits across multiple domains can be detected in the early symptomatic phase.

The role and function of follicle-stimulating hormone in the gonads have been extremely studied. However, recent research has begun to explore the relationship between elevated follicle-stimulating hormone levels and the prevalence of extragonadal disorders, particularly in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. These disorders include endometrial cancer, osteoporosis, obesity, and atherosclerosis. This review provides new insights into the relationship between follicle-stimulating hormone and the development of age-related diseases, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease. Follicle-stimulating hormone does not act alone in promoting Alzheimer's disease but often works in conjunction with inflammation, lipid accumulation, and vascular alterations. Furthermore, follicle-stimulating hormone synergizes with obesity, gut microbiota, autophagy, and aging, creating conditions that facilitate the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. This review also summarizes the therapeutic potential of FSH-blocking antibodies in treating these diseases.

Although practitioners have delivered music therapy via telehealth and researchers have investigated music teletherapy (MTT) using descriptive techniques, there is a lack of knowledge regarding how to implement MTT for people with Alzheimer's dementia (AD). A contextualized understanding of MTT for people with AD from experienced music therapists may help develop guidelines and protocols to increase access to and improve MTT. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to understand music therapists' lived experiences and recommendations providing MTT for people with AD. We conducted individual semistructured interviews with 8 qualified music therapists in the United States who had clinical experience in MTT for people with AD. We analyzed the data using thematic analysis and completed member checks to increase trustworthiness of the data and process. We identified 9 categories: (1) strength-based reconceptualization, (2) service users who can benefit from MTT, (3) clinical objectives in MTT, (4) interventions in MTT, (5) logistical aspects of MTT, (6) procedural implementation aspects, (7) technology considerations, (8) benefits of MTT, and (9) music therapists experienced meaningful fulfillment providing MTT. Categories were supported by 23 subcategories that provide situated context for providing MTT for people with AD. When integrated with an individualized assessment, the findings may help practitioners implement MTT for people with AD. Implications for clinical practice, limitations, and suggestions for future research are provided.

In recent decades, the use of certain oral anticholinergics for the treatment of hyperhidrosis has become widespread, often off-label but supported by multiple studies, including clinical trials, demonstrating their effectiveness and an apparently good safety profile. Similarly, various studies published in recent years have associated the use of anticholinergics to the development of dementia, particularly in elderly patients. Additionally, other studies have suggested that hyperhidrosis itself may be an early symptom of developing dementia. However, to date, no research has specifically linked the use of oral anticholinergics for hyperhidrosis treatment with the development of dementia. We present the currently available data on this controversial topic.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Poor sleep may play a role in the risk of dementia. However, few studies have investigated the association between polysomnography (PSG)-derived sleep architecture and dementia incidence. We examined the relationship between sleep architecture and dementia incidence across five US-based cohort studies from the Sleep and Dementia Consortium. METHODS: Percent of time spent in stages of sleep (N1, N2, N3, rapid eye movement sleep), wake after sleep onset, sleep maintenance efficiency, apnea-hypopnea index, and relative delta power were derived from a single night home-based PSG. Dementia was ascertained in each cohort using its cohort-specific criteria. Each cohort performed Cox proportional hazard regressions for each sleep exposure and incident dementia, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, antidepressant use, sedative use, and APOE e4 status. Results were then pooled in a random effects model. RESULTS: The pooled sample comprised 4657 participants (30% women) aged ≥ 60 years (mean age was 74 years at sleep assessment). There were 998 (21.4%) dementia cases (median follow-up time of 5 to 19 years). Pooled effects of the five cohorts showed no association between sleep architecture and incident dementia. When pooled analysis was restricted to the three cohorts which had dementia case ascertainment based on DSM-IV/V criteria (n = 2374), higher N3% was marginally associated with an increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio (HR): 1.06; 95%CI: 1.00-1.12, per percent increase N3, p = .050). CONCLUSIONS: There were no consistent associations between sleep architecture measured and the risk of incident dementia. Implementing more nuanced sleep metrics and examination of associations with dementia subtypes remains an important next step for uncovering more about sleep-dementia associations.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe and progressive neurodegenerative disease of the brain that has so far been treated with symptomatic drug and non-drug therapies as standard treatment. Following the approval of the monoclonal anti-amyloid antibody by the FDA, AD therapy has changed, as this therapy has made it possible to attenuate the biological disease process of AD. Lecanemab has been recommended by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for approval in patients with early AD under two conditions. Firstly, homozygous ApoE4 carriers and secondly, patients receiving oral anticoagulants should not receive lecanemab. The following narrative review explains the mechanism of action, safety and side effects of lecanemab. Furthermore, risk factors for side effects are described. Finally, the first experiences with lecanemab are reported and the efficacy and financial aspects are discussed. Lecanemab leads to a temporary reduction in amyloid-ß deposits and to a benefit that can be reflected in everyday competence, cognition and quality of life and can be described as a breakthrough in AD's therapy due to its demonstrable biological and clinical efficacy.

OBJECTIVE: Given the increasing number of people with dementia in Brazil, health and social systems must urgently plan strategies to meet the needs of this population and their families. Therefore, research on dementia costs is essential. This study estimated direct and indirect dementia-related costs in Brazil. METHODS: We used a cost-of-illness methodology to estimate dementia-related costs, in addition to household interview data from the National Report on Dementia in Brazil (ReNaDe) and public national databases to collect data on health service use and costs. Both a social and a health system perspective were used. RESULTS: The monthly cost of dementia per patient increases with advancing stages of the syndrome: USD 843.04 in the initial stage, USD 1,317.81 in the intermediate stage, and USD 1,576.15 in the advanced stage. Indirect costs represent = 73% of total expenses. The country's total expenses are the highest during the intermediate stage of dementia. CONCLUSION: Family caregivers shoulder at least 73% of the health-related costs of dementia in Brazil, highlighting the need for better support strategies for people with dementia and their families.

BACKGROUND: Despite progress in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia risk estimation, little is known about its impact at the individual and societal levels. OBJECTIVE: Introducing the explorative tri-national PreTAD project (The Predictive Turn in Alzheimer's Disease: Ethical, Clinical, Linguistic and Legal Aspects), which aims to (1) learn about attitudes, needs, and perspectives on AD dementia risk estimation of the general population and cognitively unimpaired individuals with and without contact to memory clinics, (2) identify anticipated impacts of AD dementia risk estimation and (3) discuss the implications of the paradigm shift in medicine at individual and societal levels from an ethical, linguistic and legal perspective. METHODS: Different approaches are used: (1) an assessment of a population without experience with dementia, (2) an assessment in memory clinics, and (3) an online survey of the general population. Participants include cognitively healthy adults (n=2760), first-degree relatives of dementia patients (n=150), and participants with existing (n=150) and newly diagnosed (n=90) subjective cognitive decline (SCD) from Germany, Switzerland, and Spain. RESULTS: As part of the PreTAD project, new questionnaires are developed that (1) collect attitudes, needs, and perspectives on AD dementia risk estimation and (2) assess anticipated impacts of dementia risk estimation using hypothetical blood-based biomarker dementia risk scenarios. CONCLUSION: The PreTAD study combines an interdisciplinary approach to develop a framework for predictive medicine in the preclinical stages of AD and supports improving communication of biomarker-based dementia risk estimation in clinical practice. The study was registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00029035 on 03/08/2023). TRIAL REGISTRATION: German clinical trials register (Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien, DRKS): http://www.drks.de/DRKS00029035, DRKS registration number: DRKS00029035, date of registration: 08.03.2023.

Individuals with neurocognitive disorders such as dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration sometimes show characteristic language dysfunctions. As neurocognitive disorders progress, different types of aphasia may present. To evaluate the disease‑related changes of language functions, and to determine the correlation between the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and language dyfunctions in patients with DAT or the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) or semantic dementia (SD), we used a scale for speech and reading impairment in Japanese (the Standard Language Test for Aphasia [SLTA]), and perfusion single photon emission computed tomography, and we analyzed the relationships among them. Significant differences were identified among the DAT, SD, and bvFTD groups in the SLTA subscales concerning kanji (morphographic) words. There were positive correlations between the SLTA subscales concerning kanji words and the rCBF in left temporo‑occipital regions. The patients with bvFTD showed relative rCBF preservation in the posterior cerebrum compared with the DAT and SD patients. Our results indicate that aphasia for Japanese kanji words might be related to the dysfunction of temporo‑occipital regions, and they suggest that in patients with bvFTD, preserving the CBF in the posterior cerebrum might help maintain the ability to handle morphographic words such as kanji.

High-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle diameter distribution is informative in the diagnosis of many conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, obtaining an accurate HDL size measurement is challenging. We demonstrated the utility of measuring the diameter of more than 1,800,000 HDL particles with the deep learning model YOLOv7 (you only look once) from micrographs of 183 HDL samples, including patients with dementia or normal cognition (controls). This method was shown to be more efficient and accurate than conventional image analysis software. Using this method, we found a higher abundance of small HDLs in participants with dementia compared to controls in patients with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε3ε4 genotype, whereas patients with the APOE ε3ε3 genotype had higher variability in the abundance of different HDL subclasses. Our results show an example of accurate individual HDL particle diameter measurement for large-scale clinical samples, which can be expanded to characterize the relationship between disease risk and other nanoparticles in the sub-20-nm diameter size range.

Accurate classification of neurodegenerative disorders remains a challenge in neuroscience. Using open-source electroencephalography (EEG) data, we investigated electrophysiological signatures to differentiate frontotemporal dementia (FTD) from Alzheimer's disease (AD) via complexity measures. Traditional relative band power analysis showed consistent increases in lower-frequency activity but did not distinguish the two disorders after correction. In contrast, fractal dimension and long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) revealed distinct topographical differences: AD exhibited rostral dominance in fractal dimension, whereas FTD showed caudal dominance. Both disorders demonstrated reduced LRTCs, particularly in caudal regions, indicating disrupted large-scale neural dynamics. These findings suggest that complexity-based EEG features may offer a reliable, cost-effective tool for distinguishing neurodegenerative conditions, complementing traditional neuroimaging approaches.

Dementia, a neurological disorder, can cause cognitive decline due to damage to the brain. Our study aims to contribute to the development of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to aid in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) by examining Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. EEG signals of 36 AD, 23 FTD and 29 healthy control (HC) participants were analyzed and entropy measurement approaches were used to analyze the connectivity between EEG channel pairs. The cross-permutation entropy (CPE) method and the cross conditional entropy (CCE) method were analyzed separately and the fused cross entropy (FCE) method was also tested by combining these techniques to determine the most appropriate method for feature extraction from EEG signals. The features obtained from these techniques were then evaluated in the classification phase using two separate machine learning algorithms. According to the performance evaluation criteria, the FCE and artificial neural network (ANN) model showed the most successful performance in the classification of all groups. In terms of area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy rates, 99.85% AUC and 98.46% accuracy were obtained in AD&HC groups, 99.71% AUC and 98.10% accuracy in FTD&HC groups and 99.39% AUC, 96.61% accuracy in AD&FTD groups. With the same model, an AUC rate of 97.14% and accuracy rate of 73.86% was obtained for the classification of the triple group (AD&FTD&HC). It has been observed that the results of this study show successful performance compared to the results of similar studies.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative sepsis is a severe complication associated with increased mortality and potential long-term cognitive decline, including dementia. However, the relationship between postoperative sepsis and dementia remains poorly understood. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the National Database in Taiwan, covering the period from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2022. The index period for surgeries was set between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2013, allowing the identification of patients without prior dementia. A landmark period of 12 months following surgery was defined to capture the number of postoperative sepsis events, which were then analyzed for their impact on dementia risk. After 1:4 propensity score matching (PSM), dementia and mortality were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards and Fine-Gray competing risk models. RESULTS: Following PSM, 778 patients were in the postoperative sepsis group and 3,112 in the non-postoperative sepsis group. Dementia incidence was higher in the postoperative sepsis group (26%) compared to the non- postoperative sepsis group (13.6%), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.03-1.52). A dose-response relationship was observed, with dementia rates of 24.5% for one postoperative sepsis event and 34.9% for two or more events, the latter showing an HR of 1.77 (95% CI, 1.17-2.66). Mortality was also elevated in the postoperative sepsis group (40.5% vs. 31.6%; HR 1.45, 95% CI, 1.28-1.65). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative sepsis is significantly associated with increased dementia risk in a dose-dependent manner. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing perioperative infection control to reduce both immediate and long-term cognitive complications.

We respond to the commentary by Ballenger et al. While appreciating "our provocative article", they called for "a more rigorous historical approach…". In fact, we documented from known texts how ancient physicians recognized memory loss in the elderly, Solon to Galen, who gave stereotypical descriptions of the negative aspects of old age in historical sequence. Texts from the Roman era with references to elderly memory loss did not have any earlier Greek counterpart, suggesting historically novel environmental and lifestyle factors in dementia that are associated with the modern dementia epidemic. Our initial inquiry, while historically rigorous, warrants further discussion.

Dementia is a complex condition whose multifaceted nature poses significant challenges in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients. Despite the availability of large open-source data fueling a wealth of promising research, effective translation of preclinical findings to clinical practice remains difficult. This barrier is largely due to the complexity of unstructured and disparate preclinical and clinical data, which traditional analytical methods struggle to handle. Novel analytical techniques involving Deep Learning (DL), however, are gaining significant traction in this regard. Here, we have investigated the potential of a cascaded multimodal DL-based system (TelDem), assessing the ability to integrate and analyze a large, heterogeneous dataset (n=7,159 patients), applied to three clinically relevant use cases. Using a Cascaded Multi-Modal Mixing Transformer (CMT), we assessed TelDem's validity and (using a Cross-Modal Fusion Norm - CMFN) model explainability in (i) differential diagnosis between healthy individuals, AD, and three sub-types of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (ii) disease staging from healthy cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, and (iii) predicting progression from MCI to AD. Our findings show that the CMT enhances diagnostic and prognostic accuracy when incorporating multimodal data compared to unimodal modeling and that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers play a key role in accurate model decision making. These results reinforce the power of DL technology in tapping deeper into already existing data, thereby accelerating preclinical dementia research by utilizing clinically relevant information to disentangle complex dementia pathophysiology.

Several studies show that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurocognitive disorders have a negative impact on the self and identity formation. Most studies have included persons with mild to moderate dementia, but how AD patients in the earliest phases retrieve information about themselves has only been studied scarcely. The aim of this study was to investigate if persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD would generate fewer self-related statements than healthy controls. From a memory clinic, we included 17 aMCI patients, 17 patients with mild dementia (AD; MMSE ≥ 24), and 30 healthy controls. Three Events Test and Twenty Statements Test (TST) were applied to all participants. The persons with mild dementia gave significantly fewer statements compared to the controls (p < 0.001) and the aMCI patients (p < 0.01) on TST. Fewer statements were also produced by the aMCI patients compared to the control participants (p < 0.05). Persons from both patient groups produced significantly fewer contextual details compared to the controls on the Three Events Tests. There were significant associations to lexical fluency for both the TST and Three Events Test, but only a limited amount of variance was explained, and the results cannot be explained solely by a fluency effect. The results from this study are in accordance with findings from previous studies demonstrating that mild AD leads to a decline in both autobiographical memories and a diminished sense of self. Further, this study shows that changes in self-concept may occur even in the earliest clinical stages of AD.

BACKGROUND: Visual hallucinations (VH) are an important neuropsychiatric feature of dementia. The association between VH and cognition remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differences in clinical correlates of VH and explore the associations between VH and cognitive functional decline in individuals with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Outpatient medical records of 154 patients with DLB and 297 patients with AD between January 2017 and December 2023 were reviewed. We collected demographic characteristics and used neuropsychological assessments and semi-structured detailed interviews to evaluate cognition and VH. Multiple linear regression and mediation analyses were employed to analyze the data, adjusting for confounding variables. RESULTS: DLB patients had a higher prevalence of VH than AD patients (p < 0.01). The presence of VH predicted lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores in both DLB and AD patients (p < 0.01). In DLB patients, VH were associated with lower attention function scores after adjustment (p = 0.027). In AD patients, VH were related to worsened orientation ability after adjustment (p = 0.033). Attention function partially mediated the association between VH and cognition in DLB patients (p < 0.01), whereas orientation function partially mediated this association in AD patients (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: VH may independently correlate with deterioration in global cognitive performance. In DLB patients with VH, attentional function appears to be more impaired, whereas in AD patients, orientation function is the most affected. Different cognitive domains may help distinguish between DLB and AD patients with VH.

Caregiving for family members with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) places significant burden on family members, leaving them at risk for a variety of mental and physical issues. While engaging in sufficient respite is generally considered an important resiliency factor for caregivers, recent research has demonstrated that caregivers are not satisfied with their respite and are not gaining much benefit during the limited respite time available to them. OBJECTIVES: The current study examines whether goal-oriented respite planning, facilitated by a mobile intervention, can improve caregivers' subjective experience of their respite time-use. METHOD: Caregivers (N = 85) used a mobile intervention to help them plan and evaluate their weekly respite time-use. Ecological Momentary assessments (weekly) monitored number of respite hours, respite goal achievement, and subjective assessment of their respite experience. RESULTS: Respite goal achievement on a given week predicted improvements in participants' ratings of their respite time-use outcomes one week later. Specifically, one week after reporting improved respite goal achievement, caregivers' ratings on happiness with their respite activities, feeling that their respite made them a better caregiver, and feeling like they had enough respite all increased. These effects were independent of the number of respite hours they reported per week. DISCUSSION: Engaging in weekly goal-setting and goal-review activities is associated with caregivers' subjective evaluation of their respite time-use. Interventions that help caregivers implement goal setting and achievement into their daily lives would likely benefit subjective evaluations and experiences with respite.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are both progressive neurological disorders that affect the elderly. Distinguishing between individuals suffering from these two diseases in the early stages can be quite challenging, and due to their different treatments, it has become an important problem. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can be helpful in this matter due to their high ability to manage large data and deliver high-quality diagnostic results. NEW METHOD: In this research, we integrate multiple ML algorithms into 10 ensemble learning techniques, utilizing 7 distinct features: 3 from the time domain and 4 from the frequency domain. RESULTS: They are used to achieve a higher diagnostic accuracy level in binary and multiclass classification of samples from electroencephalography (EEG) signals of elderly patients with AD, FTD, and healthy age-matching controls (CN), during the eye resting state. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The best results in carrying out binary AD/CN, FTD/CN, and AD/FTD classifications with significant accuracy>95% have been obtained with the help of the light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) method applying the wavelet transform feature. CONCLUSION: This combination (LGBM&wavelet) also displays the best performance in the AD/FTD/CN multiclass classification process with accuracy>93%.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Aging is one of the greatest risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). As the disease progresses, neural loss in brain regions, such as the olfactory cortex (OC), i.e., a set of areas including the mediotemporal and orbitofrontal regions, may lead to dysfunction in the sense of smell and affect other brain regions that relate to the olfactory cortex by either afferent or efferent projections. METHODS: The objective of this study was to assess sex-related differences in olfactory cortex volume using magnetic resonance imaging in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, probable dementia of the AD type and in healthy older adults, using the Mini-Mental Statement Examination score, years of education, and total intracranial volume as correction factors. RESULTS: Atrophy of the olfactory cortex was observed in patients of both sexes with probable AD dementia. However, at the MCI stage, significant volumetric loss in the OC was detected in females only but not in males. CONCLUSIONS: This finding indicates greater pathological effects in this region in females at an earlier disease stage than in males. This study suggests that OC volume loss occurs differently between the sexes in older adults, with volumetric loss being greater in females.

This study explored racial/ethnic differences in social support among racial/ethnic minority midlife women who are family caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease (MWPLAD) in the US. This secondary analysis used data from a cross-sectional online survey conducted among 136 MWPLAD. Structured questionnaires were used to assess the demographic and caregiving-related characteristics, perceived social support, and sociocultural factors. Moreover, the relative contributions of demographic and sociocultural factors to social support were evaluated by hierarchical linear regression analysis while controlling for race/ethnicity. Cultural justification for duty (β = .338, p < .001) and discrimination during caregiving (β = -.215, p = .014) were significant sociocultural influencing factors, and advanced age (β = -.188, p = .015) was significantly associated with low social support. Therefore, interventions based on social determinants of health are necessary to enhance social support among racial/ethnic MWPLAD.

INTRODUCTION: Among individuals who are amyloid biomarker-positive or apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers, arterial stiffness reflected by higher pulse wave velocity (PWV) has been associated with lower cognition cross-sectionally. Less is known about longitudinal associations. METHODS: The sample included 152 older adults without dementia. Linear mixed-effects models examined if PWV (1) was associated with cognitive decline and (2) interacted with APOE ɛ4 status or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid positivity on cognitive decline. RESULTS: PWV was not associated with cognitive decline across any domains. There was an interaction between PWV and CSF amyloid positivity on executive function (p = 0.038) and language (p = 0.047), such that higher PWV was related to faster decline in CSF amyloid-positive individuals relative to amyloid-negative individuals. PWV did not interact with APOE ɛ4 status on cognitive decline. DISCUSSION: PVW, as a marker of vascular risk, may adversely modify the trajectory of cognitive decline, particularly in amyloid-positive individuals. HIGHLIGHTS: Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was not associated with cognitive decline in any domain. Amyloid status moderated the effect of PWV on executive function and language decline. Higher PWV was associated with faster decline among amyloid-positive individuals. There was no interaction between PWV and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status on cognitive decline.

Meeting the care needs of people with dementia is a major public health and societal challenge. In 2020, over 6 million Americans had Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia, and this is projected to increase to 14 million by 2060. Their care needs incur nearly $30,000 more in mean annual costs per person compared to peers without dementia, and overall costs are expected to rise to $1.6 trillion within 15 years. People with dementia experience poorly coordinated care, high emergency department use, elevated hospitalization rates, and substantial variation in care. Gaps in training and high workforce turnover rates, particularly in home care and residential settings, may contribute to these outcomes. Providing quality care for dementia requires a well-trained, multidisciplinary workforce, but we lack a thorough understanding of the professionals currently providing care and the extent to which their training and composition influence outcomes. The National Dementia Workforce Study (NDWS) aims to investigate these issues on an unprecedented scale through a series of comprehensive annual surveys of dementia care providers across multiple care settings, rooted in a conceptual framework inspired by the Donabedian and Quality Health Outcomes models. Our goals are to generate a new data infrastructure and, by integrating novel survey data with other data sources, equip the research community with new tools to study relationships between workforce characteristics, care processes, and outcomes for people with dementia. Findings will provide insights into workforce dynamics, training needs, and care quality and inform strategies to improve dementia care policy, workforce capacity, and practice.

To study the impact of positive psychosocial interventions on well-being in persons with dementia, new outcome measures are needed that are strengths-based and attuned to the individual heterogeneity, intrapersonal variations in day-to-day living, and the dynamic challenges of coping with a progressive neurological disease. This paper analyzes the qualitative findings from focus groups asked about the experience of living well with dementia and the priority concepts for future research measures. Human-Centered Design (HCD) was used to obtain and analyze data from multiple sources, including individual and focus group interviews, observations in the field, and related methods to enhance empathy for the lived experience of dementia. Key approaches to living well with dementia were identified that may inform interventions, supports, and services that foster well-being. The findings from this study will be used to develop new measures to promote research on processes and outcomes associated with living well with dementia.

BACKGROUND: Cortical excitability has been proposed as a novel neurophysiological marker of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's dementia (AD). However, the link between cortical excitability and structural changes in AD is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between cortical excitability and motor cortex thickness in AD. METHODS: In 62 participants with AD (38 females, mean ± SD age = 74.6 ± 8.0) and 47 healthy control (HC) individuals (26 females, mean ± SD age = 71.0 ± 7.9), transcranial magnetic stimulation resting motor threshold (rMT) was determined, and T1-weighted MRI scans were obtained. Skull-to-cortex distance was obtained manually for each participant using MNI coordinates of the motor cortex (x = -40, y = -20, z = 52). RESULTS: The mean skull-to-cortex distances did not differ significantly between participants with AD (22.9 ± 4.3 mm) and HC (21.7 ± 4.3 mm). Participants with AD had lower motor cortex thickness than healthy individuals (t(92) = -4.4, p = <0.001) and lower rMT (i.e., higher excitability) than HC (t(107) = -2.0, p = 0.045). In the combined sample, rMT was correlated positively with motor cortex thickness (r = 0.2, df = 92, p = 0.036); however, this association did not remain significant after controlling for age, sex and diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AD have decreased cortical thickness in the motor cortex and higher motor cortex excitability. This suggests that cortical excitability may be a marker of neurodegeneration in AD.

OBJECTIVE: Impairments in emotion recognition, a crucial component of social cognition, have been previously demonstrated in patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bv-FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, to date, it is unclear whether patients with early-stage vascular dementia (VaD) display deficient emotion recognition. We investigated profiles of impairments in emotion recognition and non-social cognitive functions, comparing VaD patients to bv-FTD and AD patients, and healthy control participants (HC). METHOD: Eighty-one memory clinic patients with early-stage VaD (n = 30), bv-FTD (n = 21) and AD (n = 30), and 40 HCs were included and performed Ekman 60 Faces Test (EFT; emotion recognition), Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT; memory - encoding and retrieval) and Trailmaking Test (TMT A, TMT B, TMT B/A; information processing speed, executive functions). Differences between groups were analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA), using age, education and sex adjusted norm Z scores. RESULTS: All patient groups performed significantly worse than HCs on EFT (p < .001). Mean performance of VaD patients was in between bv-FTD and AD (only bv-FTD < AD, p < .01). All patient groups were also impaired on AVLT encoding, TMT-B and TMT B/A. Social and non-social neurocognitive functions differed between groups, with specific impairments in processing speed in VaD, emotion recognition in bv-FTD and memory retrieval in AD, and memory encoding and cognitive control impaired in all three groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found significantly different profiles in VaD, bv-FTD and AD. Assessing emotion recognition has additive value in the distinction between patient groups, allowing for more timely and accurate diagnosis in clinical practice.

Dementia, characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function, poses a significant challenge to global healthcare systems, with current therapeutic approaches offering limited efficacy. The development of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems has introduced promising avenues for enhancing the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Dendrimers, with their highly branched, nanoscale structure, provide an innovative platform for targeted drug delivery to the brain. Dendrimers serve as nanoscale drug carriers that facilitate controlled drug release, enhance bioavailability, and improve penetration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to superior therapeutic efficacy in neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, dendrimers can encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, increasing their stability and minimizing systemic side effects. This review explores the unique properties of dendrimers, focusing on their potential as drug delivery vehicles in dementia treatment. We also highlight advancements in the design and application of dendrimer-based therapeutics, emphasizing their role in targeting key pathological mechanisms underlying dementia. Through these approaches, dendrimers represent a promising strategy for developing more effective and personalized treatment modalities for patients suffering from cognitive impairment and dementia.

Frailty is a clinical syndrome characterized by diminished physiological reserves and increased vulnerability to stressors. While frailty has been largely studied in Alzheimer's disease, few study focused on Lewy body dementia (LBD). Beyond frailty, the World Health Organization recently highlights the concept of intrinsic capacity (IC), offering a promising framework for the early identification and intervention to mitigate the risk of frailty and disability in older adults. IC refers to an individual's physical and mental abilities (including five dimensions: sensory, psychology, locomotion, vitality and cognition), which support the maintenance of functional capacity and promote healthy aging. In this review, we aimed to describe the prevalence of IC decline in LBD and its potential consequences. While few studies focused specifically on this question, we found evidence in the literature of a higher prevalence of IC decline in LBD, compared to cognitively unimpaired older adults and to Alzheimer's disease patients. If future studies are needed to confirm these results, we assume that IC assessment and monitoring in LBD may be a further step towards a better integrated and personalized care for patients. This may open the avenue to develop specific tailored interventions, to decrease disability and increase quality of life and "healthy ageing" of patients despite the presence of LBD.

Music interventions show promise to support critical areas of decline for those living with dementia. There is a gap in identifying the skills and experiences necessary to facilitate the music activities in such an intervention. This pilot research creates an understanding of the characteristics and experiences of adolescent musicians who facilitated a digital, intergenerational music intervention. The research team conducted in-depth interviews with the adolescent participants and used descriptive phenomenological methodology. Eight adolescent musicians participated in the study, ranging from 14 to 18 years old. For characteristics, adolescents reported prior experience in music and key social supports. For experiences, adolescents reported decreased performance anxiety and increase in human connection and understanding of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. There is potential for researchers to explore if adolescents who facilitate such a music intervention experience less performance anxiety as well as more empathy for those living with dementia.

One of the principal objectives of the Building Our Largest Dementia Infrastructure (BOLD) program is to elevate dementia as a public health priority in state, local, territorial, and tribal health departments across the U.S. Since 2020, the BOLD program, through the stewardship of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, has supported 45 state and other health departments throughout the U.S. to refine and implement strategic public health action plans to address dementia that focus on risk reduction, early detection, and caregiving using the framework of the Healthy Brain Initiative Road Map Series. Following an overview and description of the extent of BOLD's reach, we will highlight several exemplars from individual states' work in advancing dementia as a public health priority, including efforts to engage local Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Programs to facilitate age-friendly local healthcare systems; working with diverse faith-based communities to disseminate risk reduction strategies; and supporting and training county staff to better meet the needs of dementia caregivers in their respective communities, among others. The resources, opportunities, and challenges to initiate key public health actions to address dementia vary widely across state, local, territorial, and tribal communities, and the current paper will demonstrate how CDC's BOLD Program has begun to address this rich diversity throughout the U.S.

With the clinical application of monoclonal antibody therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD), diagnostic techniques are shifting toward molecular-targeted imaging. The development of tracers for positron emission tomography (PET) targeting abnormal proteins associated with the disease, such as amyloid-beta and tau, has enabled the detection of neuropathological changes in AD in vivo. This study will contribute to the clinical diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of potential therapeutic approaches for AD. In general outpatient care, imaging modalities that employ widely available techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging or single-photon emission computed tomography remain necessary. This article provides a synopsis of the American College of Radiology recommendations concerning the clinical utility of neuroimaging techniques and reviews the temporal progression of in vivo pathologies derived from amyloid and tau PETs. We investigated the methods for distinguishing between the AD continuum and SNAP in patients with mild cognitive impairment using the ADNI database. Accurate assessment of the "cortical signature" is essential for the diagnosis of AD. Voxel-based morphometry is a useful tool because cortical atrophy is associated with the extension of tau PET lesions. Confirmation of cortical atrophy in conjunction with hippocampal atrophy offers diagnostic insights that facilitate the identification of AD.

Older adults with subjective memory complaints (SMC) often underestimate their cognitive and related functional competencies, while patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early probable Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) often overestimate their cognitive and functional abilities. We predicted that both cognitive (i.e., executive and memory) and non-cognitive (i.e., affective and motor) test performance of patients would be associated with reduced awareness of their functional limitations. Ten participants with SMC, 16 with MCI, and 10 with probable early AD were compared on measures of self and relatives' perceptions of their daily functional capacities. Reduced self-awareness was behaviorally assessed by subtracting the patient's subjective ratings of their functional abilities from the relatives' (or significant others') ratings of their functional abilities. Reduced self-awareness of functional competencies correlated with measures of language and calculation skills, memory, affect perception and expression, finger tapping movements, and overall cognitive status. The tendency to overestimate functional competences was associated with greater cognitive, affective, and motor impairments.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have found a correlation between varicose veins (VVs) and cognitive decline, and individuals with VVs have a higher prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the associations between VVs and the core pathologies of AD have not yet been investigated. The research was designed to analyze the relationships between VVs and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD pathologies. METHODS: We included 1,298 participants from the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) database without dementia. Multiple linear regression (MLR) model was applied to assess the relationships between the VVs and CSF AD biomarkers. Then, we conducted subgroup analyses according to age, gender, education levels and apolipoprotein E genotype ε4 (APOE-ε4) carrier status. Additionally, mediation effects were assessed using causal mediation analyses with 10,000 bootstrapped iterations. RESULTS: In total subjects, VVs had negative correlations with CSF Aβ(42) (β = -0.157, p = 0.038) and CSF Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) ratio (β = -0.272, p < 0.001), as well as positive correlations with CSF Aβ(40) (β = 0.170, p = 0.024), CSF p-tau (β = 0.192, p = 0.008), CSF t-tau/Aβ(42) ratio (β = 0.190, p = 0.011), and CSF p-tau/Aβ(42) ratio (β = 0.248, p = 0.001), after adjusting for age, sex, education levels and APOE-ε4 carrier status. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the relations between VVs and CSF AD biomarkers were more significant in female, mid-life adults (40-65 years), less-educated individuals and APOE-ε4 non-carriers. Moreover, CSF Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) ratio might be a partial mediator of the association between VVs and p-tau pathology. CONCLUSION: Our study found correlations between VVs and CSF AD biomarkers, suggesting that VVs may be a potential risk factor for the development of AD.

<p> Introduction: Intracranial hemorrhage (IH) causes dementia and Alzheimer's disease in the later stages. Until now, the accurate, early detection of IH, its prognosis, and therapeutic interventions have been a challenging task. Objective: A Multimodal Joint Fusion Sentiment Analysis (MJFSA) framework is proposed for the early detection and classification of IH, as well as sentiment analysis to support prognosis and therapeutic report generation. </p> <p> Methodology: MJFSA integrates radiological images and the radiological clinical narrative reports (RCNRs). In the proposed MJFSA model, MRI brain images are enhanced using the modified Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (M-CLAHE) algorithm. Enhanced images are processed with the proposed Tuned Temporal-GAN (Tuned-T-GAN) algorithm to generate temporal images. RCNRs are generated for temporal images using the Microsoft-Phi2 language model. Temporal images are processed with the Tuned-Vision Image Transformer (T-ViT) model to extract image features. On the other hand, the Bio-Bidirectional Encoder Representation Transformer (Bio-BERT) processes the RCNR texts for text feature extraction. Temporal image and RCNR text features are used for IH classification, such as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), epidural hemorrhage (EDH), subdural hemorrhage (SDH), and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), resulting in sentiment analysis for prognosis and therapeutic reports. </p> <p> Results: The MJFSA model has achieved an accuracy of 96.5% in prognosis sentiment analysis and 94.5% in therapeutic sentiment analysis. </p> <p> Discussion: The Multimodal Joint Fusion Sentiment Analysis (MJFSA) framework detects IH and classifies it using sentiment analysis for prognosis and therapeutic report generation. </p> <p> Conclusion: The MJFSA model's prognosis and therapeutic sentiment analysis report aims to support the early identification and management of risk factors associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. </p>.

Much has been written about the biological, clinical, and epidemiological aspects of dementia. Dire, sometimes apocalyptic social and policy issues have been identified and discussed, and scores of books have been published explaining all of this to a popular audience and providing practical advice for patients and their families. But the vast professional and popular discourse on dementia has largely been ahistorical and uncritical. This essay argues that history can be the basis of a more critically informed discussion of dementia by showing that attitudes and ideas often taken to be natural and inevitable are, in fact, historically contingent, shaped by specific social and cultural circumstances. History can renew a sense of possibility by pointing out that things were not always as they are now, and that they might well be different in the future.

Existing TWASs of AD dementia typically use a single statistical method to identify cell-type-specific risk genes. Here we sought to improve on existing approaches and utilized an omnibus xWAS pipeline to integrate snRNA-seq dataset (n=415) of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the latest GWAS data of AD dementia to detect cell-type-specific risk genes. We identified 223 cell-type-specific TWAS risk genes across six major brain cell types, including 91 independent associations of which 11 are novel. Integrating proteomics data (n=716) of DLPFC and GWAS data, we identified 21 significant PWAS risk genes including 13 independent associations, overlapping with 32% independent cell-type-specific TWAS associations. Protein-protein interaction network analyses showed that our TWAS findings are functionally linked to established AD risk genes such as APOE, BIN1 , and MAPT . These results underscore the value of leveraging large-scale snRNA-seq and proteomics data to uncover novel cell-type-specific mechanisms underlying AD dementia.

Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) is a leading cause of death in the United States, with national goals in place to improve the quality of care provided to this population. With little available literature on empathy training for pharmacy students in caring for patients living with ADRD, this study outlined the implementation process of an immersive sensory experience, the Virtual Dementia Tour (VDT), into a Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum and evaluated the impact of the experience on pharmacy students' empathy for persons living with ADRD. After completing the VDT, quantitative analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the pharmacy students' ability to capably complete tasks and relax, and a positive change in their perceptions of the need for improved care for persons living with ADRD. Qualitative analytical approaches identified themes of "Empathy," "Patient Care and Advocacy," "Education," as well as the cognitive, mental, and physical impact of the experience. Valuable lessons learned while providing ADRD empathy training to Doctor of Pharmacy students includes reallocation of faculty resources, curricular development of an innovative empathy-building experience for students, and improved experience delivery efficiency. Overall, a significant change in pharmacy students' empathy toward patients living with ADRD was observed.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) develops in proteinopathies involving TDP-43 (transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa), tau, and FUS (fused in sarcoma) proteins, which possess antiviral properties and exert inhibitory effects on human transposable elements. Viruses and aging have been suggested to trigger FTD by activating specific retroelements. FTD is associated with multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), most located in intergenic and regulatory regions where many transposable element genes are found. Therefore, genetic predisposition to FTD may influence the interaction between retroelements and the TDP-43, tau, and FUS proteins, causing pathological conformation changes and aggregate formation. Subsequently, these aggregates lose their ability to inhibit retroelements, leading to the activation of transposable elements. This creates a harmful negative feedback loop in which TDP-43, tau, and FUS protein expressions are further enhanced by retroelement transcripts and proteins, resulting in protein aggregate accumulation and pathological disease progression. Hence, epigenetic inhibition of pathologically activated retroelements using micro-ribonucleic acids (microRNAs) derived from transposable elements has been proposed as a potential treatment for FTD. Finally, a review of the current scientific literature identified 13 appropriate microRNAs (miR-1246, -181c, -330, -345-5p, -361, -548a-3p, -548b-5p, -548c-5p, -571, -588, -659-3p, -708-3p, -887).

Background: Early differentiation between amnestic multidomain mild cognitive impairment (aMCI-md) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical for timely diagnosis and care planning. The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 (DRS-2) is a multidomain cognitive screening tool with potential value in detecting early neurodegenerative changes, though its performance in distinguishing aMCI-md from early AD remains underexplored. Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the DRS-2 total and subscale scores in a Spanish clinical cohort by comparing cognitively unimpaired individuals, patients with aMCI-md, and those with early AD. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study including 684 participants: 333 cognitively healthy controls, 141 with aMCI-md, and 210 with early AD. The DRS-2 was administered as part of a neuropsychological battery. Receiver operating characteristic curves, area under the curve (AUC), and optimal cut-off values were used to assess discriminative performance. Results: The DRS-2 total score and the Memory and Initiation/Perseveration subscales demonstrated good discriminative accuracy across all diagnostic contrasts. In the most clinically relevant comparison (aMCI-md vs. early AD), both the total score and Memory subscale reached an AUC of .87, while Initiation/Perseveration followed closely (AUC = .83). The total score yielded 87.2% accuracy (cut-off = 126), and Memory alone achieved 86.6% accuracy (cut-off = 19). Attention and Construction subscales consistently showed limited diagnostic value. Conclusion: The DRS-2, particularly the Memory and Initiation/Perseveration subscales, appears to be a reliable tool for distinguishing the early stages of cognitive impairment, supporting its clinical use for early diagnosis and risk stratification in memory clinic settings.

Mounting evidence points to the role of semantic knowledge in modulating how we perceive, and subsequently remember, experiences. In healthy aging, prior knowledge becomes increasingly important to guide visual exploration during episodic encoding and retrieval and can hinder performance when incongruous with to-be-learned information. It remains unclear, however, how the dynamic integration of visual information and prior knowledge is altered in neurodegenerative disorders, and whether this impacts oculomotor behaviour. Here, we explored how degradation of the conceptual knowledge base in semantic dementia (SD) impacts the acquisition and retrieval of new information, and how such changes relate to oculomotor behaviour. Ten well-characterised cases of SD were compared to 12 disease-matched cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 24 healthy older Controls. Participants completed a visual search task followed by a surprise memory task where target objects were displayed in either semantically congruent or semantically incongruent locations. Oculomotor performance was evaluated by measuring the time participants spent exploring target congruent areas in each condition. Relative to Controls, visual search and memory performance was significantly compromised in AD, as indexed by slower response times, reduced task accuracy, and more extensive visual exploration directed towards target congruent areas. In contrast, SD patients scored in line with Controls for all behavioural and oculomotor measures on the visual search task when target objects were displayed in semantically incongruent locations. Overall, our findings suggest that degradation of the semantic and episodic memory systems in dementia differentially impacts visual exploration and memory retrieval depending on stimulus congruency.

Family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) living in rural areas face significant health and healthcare challenges. Limited research, however, has explored factors shaping their use of home- and community-based services (HCBS). This study identifies unmet needs among caregivers of people with ADRD in rural Western North Carolina and highlights contextual factors that facilitate HCBS use. Nineteen qualitative interviews were conducted with 21 family caregivers and 1 person with ADRD between 2021 and 2022. Thematic analyses revealed unmet needs among caregivers for information, service navigation, and caregiving support. HCBS use was shaped by multiple factors including illness needs, cultural beliefs, preferences for home-based care, and place-based resources. These findings suggest that culturally tailored HCBS are needed to support people with ADRD and their caregivers in rural Appalachian communities, especially those which facilitate access to paid caregiving, clearly communicate program eligibility requirements, and emphasize service availability.

INTRODUCTION: While there is growing appreciation of the importance of sociobiological determinants of dementia, few lifespan cohorts offer well-characterized dementia outcomes to explore these aims. We sought to identify dementia prevalence in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS), one of the most comprehensive lifespan cohort studies in the United States. Highlights We found dementia prevalence in the WLS to be 8.9% when this large population-based cohort was sampled at a mean age of 81. Of the identified dementia cases, 79% were clinically determined to be due to a presumed underlying etiology of AD. The targeted multiphased assessment approach used to classify dementia in WLS will be iteratively repeated over time to capture new dementia incidence, complemented by parallel efforts to link WLS with Medicare claims data to identify additional dementia cases among non-respondents or those not selected into the ILIAD sampling frame. Ongoing data collection efforts include in-home blood collection efforts to characterize plasma levels of AD biomarkers in the WLS cohort. When resultant dementia classifications are combined with the robust prospectively collected life course data covering a wide array of socioeconomic, educational, occupational, social, behavioral, and physical health variables, the WLS dataset offers an unparalleled opportunity to investigate the sociobiological determinants of late-life dementia. METHODS: Using a targeted multiphased assessment approach, participants were first screened for dementia risk using a phone-based cognitive assessment. Those scoring below cut-off underwent additional cognitive/medical assessment to determine a consensus-based cognitive diagnosis and suspected underlying etiology. RESULTS: Cognitive status was determined for 5414 participants, with a dementia prevalence of 8.9% when assessed at a mean age of 81 years. DISCUSSION: The WLS offers prospectively collected data covering nearly every facet of participant's lives from high school to late life. When combined with newly defined dementia outcomes, the WLS dataset offers a valuable resource to explore full life course determinants of dementia.

Renal pelvis rupture (RPR) with clinical presentation of acute abdomen is an unusual clinical event and in a patient with Alzheimer's dementia is unique in its clinical presentation and differentiating the diagnosis. We report a case of a 75-year-old male Alzheimer's patient who complained of sudden right-sided flank and abdominal pain followed by nausea, and vomiting, without a history or signs of external trauma. Abdominal ultrasound showed fluid collection close to the right renal pelvis with first-grade hydronephrosis. Computed tomography revealed right colon overdistension and, a 2 mm proximal right ureteral stone, and contrast urography showed a dilated right renal pelvis with extravasation. After the endoscopic treatment with double-J stent, no contrast extravasation was seen on the control CTU, and the stent was removed after four weeks. Patients with Alzheimer's dementia presenting with acute abdomen and flank pain should be evaluated for renal pelvis rupture with prompt diagnosis and management.

OBJECTIVE: The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) playing a crucial role in neuron survival and function, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our study seeks to explore polymorphisms in miRNAs that regulate the BDNF gene in individuals with AD, and to reveal the relationship between these polymorphisms and APOE genotypes. METHODS: Seventy AD patients who applied to the Psychiatry outpatient clinic were recruited for the study as well as 70 healthy individuals in the same age. The cases were examined for 5 miRNAs regulating BDNF and 2 APOE SNPs using the SNPType method on the Fluidigm platform. RESULTS: In comparisons of the genotype distributions for three polymorphisms (miR-206 rs16882131, miR-30e rs112439044, miR-26b rs188612260) (p < 0.01 all) and the allele frequencies for two polymorphisms (miR-30e rs112439044, miR-26b rs188612260) (p < 0.01) detected significant differences between groups. While the APOE e4/e4 genotype was detected in 4.50% of the AD group, no individual with this genotype was observed in the control group. When the correlation between miRNA polymorphisms and APOE genotypic distributions were investigated, the miR-30e rs10489167 polymorphism showed a statistically significant positive correlation with the ε2/ε2 genotype and a statistically significant negative correlation with the e2/e3 genotype (p < 0.08 and p < 0.001, respectively). On the other hand, the miR-30e rs112439044 polymorphism exhibited a statistically significant positive correlation with the e2/e2 and ε2/ε2 genotypes (p < 0.03 and p < 0.07, respectively). CONCLUSION: These findings could potentially offer insights into the mechanisms underlying AD.

Accurate differentiation of Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and healthy control (HC) is critical for early diagnosis and intervention of brain disorders. This study introduces a deep learning framework that leverages electroencephalography (EEG)-derived multiband functional connectivity (FC) features. Multiband Morlet wavelet mutual information (MMMIFC) was utilized to generate high-resolution FC matrices across 1-20 Hz, which were subsequently processed by a 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) based on a modified VGG architecture. The proposed model achieved classification accuracies of 90.77 % for AD vs HC and 90.38 % for FTD vs HC, with sensitivity and specificity of 88.89 % and 93.10 % for AD vs HC, and 86.96 % and 93.10 % for FTD vs HC, respectively. Beyond classification performance, the analysis identified distinct EEG-based biomarkers within the default mode network. In AD analysis, global efficiency, diffusion efficiency, and clustering coefficient were consistently reduced in the delta and theta bands, reflecting disrupted low-frequency network integration and the theta band presents the most prominent group differences between AD and HC. In FTD analysis, graph theory metrics were also reduced in the delta and theta bands, with the delta band showing the most pronounced group differences compared to HC.

BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) accounts for around 5% of all forms of dementia and often starts at a relatively young age. It poses challenges for relatives and carers. This article focuses on changes with respect to sexuality. Studies have so far mainly focussed on neuronal changes and only marginally on the altered sexuality of people with FTD and the associated difficulties for partners. Sexuality and intimacy should be seen as a basic human need, even for people with dementia. AIM OF THE WORK: The challenges of altered sexuality of people with FTD in their couple relationships were surveyed in order to identify forms of behavior of sufferers and derive conclusions for the practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprises expert interviews (n = 8). These were analyzed using a content-structuring qualitative content analysis according to Kuckartz. RESULTS: The interviews clearly show that people with FTD experience a different sexuality as a result of the disease, both in the form of hypersexual and hyposexual behavior. Both forms of behavior lead to changes in couple relationships. DISCUSSION: The results indicate the need to destigmatize those affected as hypersexual per se and the relevance of professional support for those affected and organizations. An integrative approach is required in which protection and enabling a healthy sexuality with FTD are considered together.

Health care workers with specialized knowledge and skills to work with people living with symptoms of dementia are needed in all sectors of the health care industry in Hawai'i as the number of people in the population diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is expected to increase along with the overall number of older adults (ages 65+). This article provides a scoping review of relevant population data that suggest an urgency to address this need even as the state contends with an overall shortage of workers throughout the public health and health care industry. The authors then provide practical solutions, recommending a multi-pronged approach to introduce or enhance dementia-care competencies at various levels of education - from high school to graduate or professional studies - and through continuing education and professional development programs for practicing health professionals. Consistent with the public health philosophy of health equity, the authors propose that providing quality care to persons living with dementia is a social justice goal that can be achieved through this multi-pronged approach.

Addressing modifiable dementia risk factors requires reliable risk assessment methods. We aimed to synthesise knowledge on risk scores for all cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia, classify them according to target population, evaluate their content, cost, appropriateness of validation studies, and suitability for implementing risk reduction guidelines. A systematic search was conducted of PubMed, Cochrane Collaboration, ProQuest, Scopus, Embase, and PsycINFO databases using a pre-registered protocol. Data on risk factors, target population, predictive validity, cost, and alignment with WHO guidelines were extracted. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. Of 45 risk scores identified, 29 were for all-cause dementia, including 11 based on late-life cohorts, 6 on midlife, and 7 covering mid to late-life. The pooled C-statistic across development and validation studies of dementia risk scores was 0.69 (95 % CI: 0.67, 0.71). Development study AUCs were higher than validation study AUCs and dropped from 0.74 to 0.66 for risk scores developed for clinical samples and from 0.79 to 0.71 for AD specific scores (which include functional indicators non-independent of disease). There were no validated risk scores for vascular dementia. Dem-NCD, CogDrisk, ANU-ADRI and LIBRA risk scores incorporated most WHO-recommended risk factors and demonstrated accuracy comparable to the overall pooled C-statistic. We conclude that across the field, there are methodological limitations relating to validation, and inappropriate comparison of tools designed for different purposes or target populations. However, there are now several validated, risk scores for all-cause dementia and AD that assess modifiable factors and offer cost-effective dementia risk assessment and risk reduction advice.

BackgroundThis study assessed the prevalence, characteristics, and contributing factors of violent behaviors in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) as reported by their caregivers.MethodsA nationwide survey was conducted in France targeting caregivers of FTD patients. The survey was disseminated online between July and September 2022 through the French FTD association communications channels. It collected data on the frequency, types and targets of violent behaviors, and associated behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Associations between violent behaviors, BPSD, and demographic factors were explored.Results167 answers were analyzed. Violent behaviors were reported in 56.29% of patients with FTD, predominantly verbal (83.2%), often directed at caregivers (68.1%). Factors associated with violence included higher proxy NPI, delusions, agitation/aggression, and irritability scores. Violent behaviors were underreported, with only 48.8% of caregivers having disclosed them to health professionals.ConclusionsViolent behaviors in patients suffering from FTD appear often underreported. Systematic screening during medical appointments is recommended to ensure early intervention and better management.

BackgroundEmerging evidence suggests that the built environment (BE) and social vulnerability of communities play a critical role in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia burden. However, to what extent they are predictive of dementia burden nationally and regionally remains understudied.ObjectiveThis study investigates the cross-sectional associations between county-level BE and social vulnerability index (SVI) variables and AD dementia prevalence across the US and identifies the key variables within each region.MethodsWe applied eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) models nationally and regionally using a combined set of BE and SVI variables. Variable importance was assessed using SHapley Additive Explanations values.ResultsSignificant regional differences in AD dementia prevalence were observed (F = 126.56, p < 0.05). XGBoost consistently outperformed RF when using SVI and BE variables, with the highest predictive accuracy observed in the Northeast (R² = 0.92), followed by the South (R² = 0.73), West (R² = 0.72), and Midwest (R² = 0.72). In the Northeast, BE variables alone explained most of the variance, with grocery store density and walkability emerging as key variables. In contrast, the BE-only model for the South performed poorly but improved substantially with the inclusion of SVI variables. In the Midwest and West regions, both BE and SVI variables contributed more evenly to the model predictions.ConclusionsWhile BE variables are more influential in urbanized regions with increased infrastructure (Northeast), SVI variables play a stronger role in more socioeconomically disadvantaged regions (South), underscoring the need for region-specific interventions.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Deep learning models have gained widespread adoption in healthcare for accurate diagnosis through the analysis of brain signals. Neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FD) are increasingly prevalent due to age-related brain volume reduction. Despite advances, existing models often lack comprehensive multi-class classification capabilities and are computationally expensive. This study addresses these gaps by proposing EEGConvNeXt, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) model for detecting AD and FD using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with high accuracy. MATERIALS AND METHOD: In this research, we employ an open-access EEG signal public dataset containing three distinct classes: AD, FD, and control subjects. We then constructed a newly proposed EEGConvNeXt model comprised of a 2-dimensional CNN algorithm that firstly converts the EEG signals into power spectrogram-based images. Secondly, these images were used as input for the proposed EEGConvNeXt model for automated classification of AD, FD, and a control outcome. The proposed EEGConvNeXt model is therefore a lightweight model that contributes to a new image classification CNN structure based on the transformer model with four primary stages: a stem, a main model, downsampling, and an output stem. RESULTS: The EEGConvNeXt model achieved a classification accuracy of ∼95.70% for three-class detection (AD, FD, and control), validated using a hold-out strategy. Binary classification cases, such as AD versus FD and FD versus control, achieved accuracies exceeding 98%, demonstrating the model's robustness across scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed EEGConvNeXt model demonstrates high classification performance with a lightweight architecture suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings. While the study establishes a novel framework for AD and FD detection, limitations include reliance on a relatively small dataset and the need for further validation on diverse populations. Future research should focus on expanding datasets, optimizing architecture, and exploring additional neurological disorders to enhance the model's utility in clinical applications.

A bibliometric analysis was conducted with a focus on global literature from 1967 to 2024 to conduct a thorough analysis of the scientific literature on early onset dementia (EOD) and its symptoms. A review of 2,433 articles focused on EOD revealed a marked upward trend in publications, especially after 1991. The United States led the world in research output, followed by the United Kingdom and Japan. The most active college was University College London. As the first study of its kind, it uses bibliometrics to analyze the global field of EOD (1967-2024) using a variety of indicators, offering fresh perspectives on the areas of greatest interest and emerging trends in the field.

Dementia poses a significant challenge to global health. This chapter reviews current literature to investigate the potential protective effects of happiness and positive emotions against dementia. Studies suggest that individuals experiencing higher levels of happiness and frequent positive emotions may exhibit lower risks of developing dementia. Mechanisms proposed include the role of positive emotions in stress reduction, which could mitigate neurodegenerative processes. In addition, recent studies have begun exploring the impact of positive psychological states, such as happiness and positive emotions, on cognitive health. Furthermore, positive psychological states have been linked to healthier lifestyle choices, including physical activity and social engagement, which are known to support cognitive function. Despite promising findings, challenges remain in establishing causal relationships and elucidating specific neurobiological pathways. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies with diverse populations to clarify these relationships and inform effective interventions. Understanding how happiness and positive emotions influence dementia risk could lead to novel preventive strategies and improve quality of life for aging populations worldwide. This chapter summarizes the potential benefits of happiness and positive emotions in mitigating the risk of dementia, highlighting the need for further research to establish causal links and develop targeted interventions.

This essay argues that suffering in persons with dementia is more than a matter of personal experience. It is knowable by others and does not need to rely on the reports of the patient to affirm it. It is even possible for a person to claim not to be suffering-"I'm doing fine"-but for others to conclude to the contrary-"You are suffering." A key property of this objective account is the caregiver observes the suffering. This observation is a product of the work of caregiving and this work relies on perceiving and supporting the mind of the person living with dementia. When that work of mind support is successful, it creates a feeling of being at home. When it is not, suffering ensues.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a highly heritable group of neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by varying clinical and pathological features. TARDBP gene has been described worldwide within the FTD/ALS spectrum but its association with right and left temporal variant of FTD (tvFTD) is still unclear. This study aimed to reclassify a Sardinian FTD cohort according to proposed criteria for the semantic behavioral variant FTD (sbvFTD), explore TARDBP mutations' association with tvFTD, and review related literature. From our FTD cohort of 94 patients, ten fulfilled the criteria for sbvFTD. Therefore, in light of the diagnostic reclassification carried out, we describe the largest series of unrelated patients with TARDBP p.A382T missense mutation, including four new cases of tvFTD: two sbvFTD and two svPPA, exhibiting semantic and behavioral disorders and showing predominant right and left anterior temporal lobe involvement, respectively. We present for the first time two sbvFTD cases carrying the pA382T TARDBP mutation. Comparison with C9orf72 and non-mutated patients revealed lower age at onset (p = 0.006), and a higher prevalence of tvFTD, particularly sbvFTD (p < 0.001), and motor neuron disease in TARDBP carriers (p < 0.001). Our findings along with a review of the literature highlighted TARDBP mutations' association with sbvFTD and semantic dementia, suggesting a genetic role in temporal variants of FTD and emphasizing the need for TARDBP mutation screening in these cases. Reclassifying FTD cohorts, including the sbvFTD phenotype, could aid in better defining the clinical spectrum of tvFTD and guide differential diagnosis across different FTD populations with TARDBP or other FTD-related mutations.

OBJECTIVES: The second International Summit on Intellectual Disability and Dementia, held in 2023, highlighted the unique challenges of diagnosing dementia in older autistic adults, particularly those with intellectual disabilities, due to the complex interplay of cognitive, communicative, and behavioral factors. This article addresses key diagnostic issues and post-diagnostic considerations for this population. METHOD: A consensus report was developed by the Summit's Autism/Dementia Working Group through background reviews, expert discussions at the Summit, and iterative draft revisions, incorporating feedback from internal and external stakeholders. Key issues were extracted from the report and abridged for this manuscript. RESULTS: Diagnostic challenges stem from overlapping symptoms of co-occurring neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions, rendering standard dementia tools insufficient. Comprehensive evaluations tailored to autism-related traits, sensory sensitivities, and alternative communication methods are essential. Building diagnostic capacity among clinicians and fostering multidisciplinary collaboration are critical. Longitudinal assessments, initiated before dementia symptoms appear, facilitate early detection of subtle changes. Emerging biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques show promise and should be incorporated where feasible. Accommodations, such as virtual assessments in familiar settings, can enhance diagnostic accuracy by reducing anxiety. Creating transition processes from diagnostics to post-diagnostic supports will aid in mitigating challenges and enhance life quality when dementia is a factor. CONCLUSIONS: Research and clinician education are urgently needed to improve diagnostic approaches and streamline the transition from diagnosis to tailored post-diagnostic support. An integrated framework of comprehensive efforts is vital for our better understanding of age-associated neuropathological diagnostics and enabling long-term well-being of older autistic adults with dementia.

BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share common risk factors and often coexist. This study investigates the relationship between cerebral arterial features and cognitive decline in patients with clinical AD dementia and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using quantitative analysis of Time-Of-Flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). METHODS: 131 patients (101 AD dementia, 30 amnestic MCI) underwent baseline TOF-MRA and cognitive assessments and 24-month follow-up cognitive tests. Total distal arterial length was measured using a custom-designed semi-automatic intracranial vascular map construction software. Associations between total distal arterial length and cognitive changes were analyzed using multiple linear regression and repeated measures analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Shorter total distal arterial length was significantly associated with greater 2-year decline in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores over 2 years (r = 0.199, p = 0.020). This association remained significant after adjusting for various confounding factors, including age, sex, education, brain parenchymal fraction, white matter hyperintensities, ApoE4 status, and vascular risk factors. Similar trends were observed for Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, although not reaching statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative measurements of cerebral vasculature on TOF-MRA are independently associated with cognitive decline in patients with clinical AD dementia and amnestic MCI. This suggests that reduced cerebral blood flow may contribute to cognitive decline in these patients, highlighting the potential role of vascular factors in AD progression. These findings support the use of quantitative cerebral arterial measurements as a potential imaging biomarker for cognitive decline in AD.

BACKGROUND: People with Down syndrome have a genetically increased risk of developing early onset Alzheimer's dementia. An interview study with healthcare providers, patient representatives and employees in residential and work facilities was conducted to identify deficits in the healthcare process and approaches to overcoming them. METHOD: In this study 14 semi-structured interviews were conducted and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: A lack of knowledge and experience on the part of medical service providers in dealing with and providing medical care for people with Down syndrome was identified as a key challenge. In addition, the diagnosis of dementia in people with Down syndrome is difficult for various reasons (including lack of appropriate diagnostic tools in standard care and lack of time or financial resources). Doubts were expressed about the efficacy of antidementia medications and the reasons for the increased use of sedatives were discussed. Attentive observation of behavior and involvement of caregivers, regular review and reduction of polypharmacy and the use of alternative behavior modification techniques were mentioned as possible solutions. CONCLUSION: The identified deficits in the medical care of the target population and the approaches to solving them will be incorporated into the development of health policy recommendations in order to optimize the care situation of those affected in the long term.

OBJECTIVES: This article features results of a qualitative research conducted with twenty-nine men and women responsible for Alzheimer's cafés in Italy, on the topic of ethical issues in dementia care. The goal was to identify the sources of moral distress for caregivers, exploring some bottom-up solutions that have been implemented shared with others in informal settings. METHOD: During the in-depth interviews participants shared about challenges and opportunities related to dementia care and ethics, informed by the symbolic interactionist approach to the theory of social representations. RESULTS: The analysis of interviews resulted in identification of six main themes, each with some sub-themes: awareness, personhood, social connectedness, isolation, access, and institutional dimension. CONCLUSION: The results pointed out the importance of culturally appropriate approach and advocacy for tackling ethical issues, especially in the light of morally wrong egregious abuse of persons with dementia (as related by participants), which can be classified as benefits trafficking, a form of human trafficking.

People with dementia (PWD) are frequently exposed to polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medication use, in which the risks of medication use outweigh the benefits or the medication is not aligned with treatment goals. Appropriate deprescribing of unnecessary or potentially inappropriate medications is essential to high-quality care for PWD, to avoid iatrogenic harm and improve health and well-being for patients and their care partners. In this article, we review the risks of polypharmacy in PWD and evidence for the safety and efficacy of deprescribing in this population. Building off existing deprescribing frameworks for older adults with multimorbidity and limited life expectancy, we provide a roadmap for deprescribing in PWD that addresses the unique challenges of living dementia, including the variable disease course, high prevalence of distressing behavioral symptoms, and central role of care partners. The steps include: (1) identify potential targets for deprescribing by eliciting medication-related goals and considering tradeoffs, (2) develop a tapering plan, (3) complete additional actions that are necessary before deprescribing, and (4) provide close follow-up. Lastly, we provide evidence-based strategies for communicating with patients and their care partners about deprescribing, adapted from the FRAME tool.

BackgroundCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core biomarkers play a pivotal role in the biological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While various commercial assays and kits are available for quantifying these biomarkers, their performance across diverse clinical settings remains insufficiently evaluated.ObjectiveThis study aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of AD core biomarkers using four measurement methods in a Chinese population and to establish method-specific cutoff values tailored to different clinical scenarios.MethodsA total of 309 participants were enrolled from the PUMCH dementia cohort, comprising 176 AD, 114 non-AD dementia cases, and 19 cognitively normal controls (CN). For biomarker quantification, we employed one manual immunoassay (INNOTEST, conducted in two independent laboratories) and two fully automated immunoassay platforms (Lumipulse G and Roche Elecsys). These methods were used to measure CSF Aβ(1-40), Aβ(1-42), t-tau, and p-tau(181), and to calculate three biomarker ratios (Aβ(1-42)/Aβ(1-40), t-tau/Aβ(1-42), and p-tau(181)/Aβ(1-42)).ResultsOur findings provide method-specific and clinical context-optimized cutoff values for each application scenario including clinically diagnosed AD versus non-AD dementia, amyloid PET-positive versus PET-negative dementia, and AD versus CN. The accuracy of differential diagnosis was higher using biomarker ratios (Aβ(1-42)/Aβ(1-40), t-tau/Aβ(1-42), p-tau(181)/Aβ(1-42)) than absolute values. Most of the high accuracy was achieved using automated assays especially Lumipulse G rather than manual assays.ConclusionsIn this first comparative study of three immunoassays in a Chinese cohort, automated assays demonstrated superior performance compared to manual assays. We established assay-specific cutoff values tailored to different clinical contexts in a Chinese population.

PURPOSE: Getting Connected: Experiential Dementia Skills Training, based on the Positive Approach to Care(®) model, was implemented to bridge the gap between knowledge and skills to determine whether nursing students feel more comfortable and prepared to care for persons living with dementia (PLWD). METHOD: The study examined the impact of experiential dementia skills training on nursing students' knowledge, comfort, and confidence when interacting with PLWD. The training was conducted at a 4-year pre-licensure, Bachelor of Science Nursing program in rural Southeast United States, where 62 sophomore students completed a 6-hour dementia skills training. Participation in the study was voluntary. Students were given pre- and posttests, with the dementia skills training serving as the intervention. Thirty-two students completed pre- and posttests, measuring knowledge, comfort, and confidence. RESULTS: Findings showed the training enhanced students' knowledge of dementia and communication approaches; however, they did not feel more confident or comfortable interacting with PLWD immediately following the training. CONCLUSION: The Getting Connected: Experiential Dementia Skills Training using the Positive Approach to Care(®) model can be a useful approach for teaching nursing students about the lived experience of dementia and beneficial in helping them acquire knowledge and communication strategies for caring for PLWD.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common type of dementia and it is important to detect AD by an appropriately cheap and non-invasive method in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) phase, which is accepted as the prodromal phase of AD. We aimed to investigate whether AD patients, amnestic MCI (aMCI) patients, and healthy controls (HCs) could be distinguished from each other by using mismatch negativity (MMN) together with neuropsychological tests. METHODS: Twenty-one individuals with mild AD, 26 with aMCI, and 18 HCs matched for age, sex, and education were included. Sociodemographic data, neuropsychological tests, Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scores, and MMN parameters acquired using an auditory oddball paradigm with an interstimulus interval of 1 second were evaluated for all three groups. RESULTS: There was no difference in terms of MMN latencies but frontal MMN amplitude was significantly lower in AD patients compared to the aMCI and HC groups. Linear regression analysis revealed that IADL scores were predicted by the Fz amplitude and Mini Mental State Examination and apathy scores. Logistic regression analysis showed that Fz amplitude, verbal fluency, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory total scores distinguished AD patients from HCs, while the Stroop 5 completion time distinguished those with MCI from HCs. Age, Fz amplitude, and verbal fluency performance distinguished AD patients from individuals with MCI. CONCLUSION: MMN might be a useful approach in differentiating AD from MCI and healthy aging when used together with neuropsychological tests rather than being used alone because it may be affected by confounding factors such as age, severity of temporoparietal neurodegeneration, and duration of the interstimulus interval.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is marked by the pathological accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain. Its key pathological features include extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles, both of which contribute to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Familial AD is linked to mutations in the APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 genes, which promote increased Aβ production or aggregation. In contrast, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), including FTDP-17, is associated with MAPT mutations that lead to tau fibril accumulation independent of Aβ pathology. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have revealed disease-specific conformations of Aβ and tau fibrils at atomic resolution, highlighting the role of structural polymorphism in disease progression. Aβ contributes to synaptic deficits and activates glial cells, thereby initiating neuroinflammatory responses. Genetic risk factors such as APOE and TREM2 influence these pathological processes. Transgenic mouse models carrying familial mutations have replicated certain aspects of AD pathology. However, most models fail to fully reproduce the human-like filament structures or the sequential progression from Aβ to tau pathology. Novel knock-in models, combined with cryo-EM-based validation, now provide a more accurate platform for studying disease mechanisms and developing targeted therapies.

The co-occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and dementia is increasingly common in aging populations. Anticoagulants reduce the risk of thromboembolic events associated with AF, but they introduce an increased risk of severe bleeding, adherence concerns, and questionable net benefit in the very elderly. This narrative review evaluates the existing literature on anticoagulation in the subset of patients with AF and dementia and aims to clarify clinical guidance on managing AF alongside bleeding risk concerns. Observational cohort studies, meta-analyses, and registry data were analyzed. Multiple large cohort studies support anticoagulation in patients with mild-to-moderate dementia. Advanced dementia populations show more mixed outcomes, though most studies still find neutral to modestly beneficial mortality effects. Direct oral anticoagulants may be preferable to warfarin due to ease of use and lower risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Notably, existing randomized controlled trials on the effects of anticoagulation in AF do not include dementia subgroups. In conclusion, anticoagulation appears to offer a net mortality benefit in patients with AF and early-stage dementia, but its use in very elderly patients with advanced dementia requires cautious, individualized consideration of patient goals and risk/benefit profile. Further research, including RCTs with dementia subgroups and quality-of-life endpoints, is urgently needed.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent heart rhythm disorder worldwide with a prevalence of 1%-2% in general population. It is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, including increased risk of dementia. In addition to cognitive impairment, AF has been related to anxiety and mood disorders. Herein we review the literature on the association between AF and neuropsychiatric conditions, including anxiety and mood disorders. The mechanisms underlying the association between AF and dementia are complex, including stroke, chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, and systemic inflammation. There is a bidirectional interaction between AF and anxiety/mood disorders with shared mechanisms involving dysfunction of the autonomic, neuroendocrine and immune systems. Optimizing pharmacological treatment, avoiding drug interactions and implementing behavioral interventions can have a lasting impact on patients with AF undergoing rhythm/rate control therapies and/or catheter ablation.

AIM: This study aimed to explore differences in the emotions of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's dementia (AD) in group rehabilitation using facial analysis. METHOD: We conducted rehabilitation consisting of aerobic exercise, cognitive training, dual tasks (a combination of exercise and cognitive training), and creative activities in a group format with patients with MCI and dementia. The faces of the 30 patients (MCI: n=14; mild/moderate AD: n=16) who participated were filmed from the front with a small camera during the four tasks. Then, we used the Kokoro Sensor (CAC Corporation, Japan), a device which estimates emotion scores (anger, contempt, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise) based on different parts of the face using artificial intelligence, to calculate emotion scores for each activity, and compared them between the MCI and AD groups. RESULTS: Emotion scores for fear and surprise were significantly higher for the AD group than for the MCI group during dual tasks (p=0.016), while emotion scores for joy were significantly higher for the MCI group than for the AD group during creative activities (p=0.012). CONCLUSION: Creative activities and dual tasks, which require simultaneous physical activity and cognitive thinking, were difficult for patients with AD. On the other hand, tasks which used a range of cognitive functions, such as creative activities, evoked joy in patients with MCI. It may be beneficial to provide tasks and support to patients with respect to their unique emotions based on these results.

BACKGROUND: Our limited understanding of dementia's complex pathogenesis confines treatment options primarily to symptom management rather than targeting underlying disease processes, underscoring the need for innovative treatment and preventive strategies. This study aimed to examine the relationship between optic neuritis (ON), an autoimmune inflammatory condition of the optic nerve, and the risk of developing dementia. METHODS: This nationwide, population-based cohort study was conducted in Korea, analyzing a cohort of 15,286 ON patients newly diagnosed between 2010 and 2017 who were age and sex matched against 76,430 controls without ON. Primary outcomes were incident cases of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or other types of dementia. Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed to assess the association between ON and dementia risk after adjusting for demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, and other comorbidities. Dementia risk was assessed through hazard ratios (HRs), with an average follow-up period of 3.06 years. RESULTS: ON patients shows greater risks of all-cause dementia (HR: 1.258) and Alzheimer's disease (HR: 1.264). Associations between ON and dementia are prominent in younger patients and current smokers. CONCLUSION: This research suggests that autoimmunity, particularly in the form of ON, may significantly contribute to dementia development. This study implies that younger ON patients who smoke could be at a high risk of developing dementia, emphasizing the need for preventative strategies and additional research to establish causality. This work broadens the scope of known dementia risk factors and opens new avenues for research into autoimmune mechanisms as targets for therapeutic intervention.

Affective prosody, the expression of emotion via speech, is critical for successful communication. In dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), impairments in expressive prosody may contribute to interpersonal difficulties, yet the underlying acoustic and neural mechanisms are not well understood. This exploratory study examined affective prosody production and cortical activation in individuals with DAT using a multimodal approach. Ten participants with DAT completed three speech tasks designed to elicit happy, sad, and neutral emotional tones. Acoustic features were extracted using Praat software, and cerebral hemodynamics were recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), focusing on oxygenated (HbO) and total (HbT) hemoglobin levels across hemispheres. Multinomial logistic regression showed that initial fundamental frequency and speech rate significantly predicted emotional condition. Paired-sample t-tests revealed hemispheric differences in HbO and HbT during affective speech, particularly in the happy and neutral conditions. These findings suggest that individuals with DAT may exhibit reduced modulation of affective prosody and altered patterns of hemispheric activation during emotionally expressive speech. While preliminary and limited by the absence of a control group, this study highlights behavioral and neural features that may contribute to communication challenges in DAT and provides a foundation for future research on affective prosody as a potential target for intervention or monitoring.

INTRODUCTION: AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. While traditional treatments targeting beta-amyloid accumulation have shown limited success, there is a pressing need for novel therapeutic approaches. Recent studies have highlighted the role of disrupted gamma oscillations in AD pathology, leading to the exploration of gamma neuromodulation as a potential therapeutic strategy to modify disease progression in individuals with AD dementia. This pilot clinical trial aimed to investigate the electrophysiological effects of low intensity gamma transcranial magnetic stimulation (gTMS) on gamma oscillations in patients with a diagnosis of probable mild AD dementia. METHODS: Employing a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, 2 × 2 crossover design, participants underwent a single session of both real low intensity gTMS and sham stimulation. EEG recordings and cognitive assessments were conducted before and after stimulation to assess changes in brain activity and their impact on episodic memory. RESULTS: We observed statistically significant changes in EEG activity (n = 14), indicating transient modulation of gamma oscillations immediately after low intensity gTMS. There was no significant improvement in cognition compared to baseline scores, but we evidenced a positive correlation between electrophysiological changes and cognitive outcome. Importantly, the intervention was well-tolerated, with no significant adverse effects reported. DISCUSSION: Low intensity gTMS has shown the capability to induce significant changes in brain activity, particularly in gamma oscillations. These findings suggest that low intensity gTMS holds promise as a safe and non-invasive therapeutic approach, challenging the conventional belief that high intensity magnetic pulses are necessary for effective brain modulation. To corroborate these initial findings, further research with extended intervention durations and larger, well-defined cohorts of patients with mild AD dementia is essential. This will validate the potential benefits of low intensity gTMS on cognitive performance in this population.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread neurodegenerative condition that has a growing impact on a global scale. This study aims to examine the relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the synaptic biomarker growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) through the utilization of arterial spin labeling (ASL). The research identified noteworthy correlations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GAP-43 levels, CBF, and cognitive composite scores, especially among participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who possess the APOE-ε4 gene. METHODS: The study examined 92 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including 36 cognitively normal (CN) and 56 MCI. The cognitive status of 42 participants was evaluated using ADNI composite scores. Independent t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests were used for the comparison of continuous variables between groups, and multiple linear regression analysis with adjustments for confounding factors was used to assess the relationship between GAP-43 and CBF values. RESULTS: Significant positive correlations were observed between GAP-43 levels and (A) the executive function composite score (ADNI_EF) in CN individuals, as well as (B) the language composite score (ADNI_LAN) in individuals with MCI. CSF biomarkers and ASL regions did not show statistical significance between diagnostic groups after correction for multiple comparisons. No significant differences in baseline characteristics were found between diagnostic groups. However, associations were observed between ROI CBF and Mini Mental State Examination in various subgroups. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate a potential function for ASL perfusion in identifying early AD-related alterations and gaining insight into the pathophysiology of AD and mild cognitive impairment.The study revealed associations between CBF, cognitive scores, and APOE-ε4 gene status. This study contributes to the comprehension of the correlation between CSF biomarkers, regional brain perfusion, and cognitive function in individuals with AD using ASL as a noninvasive approach.

The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rising annually, imposing a severe burden on patients and society. Therefore, assisted AD assessment is crucial. The decline in language function and the cognitive impairment it reflects are key external manifestations of AD. Many studies have utilized speech analysis to achieve convenient, non-invasive, and low-cost AD detection. Although state-of-the-art researches achieve high-precision AD detection using multimodal information, these studies often ignore interactions between different modalities and lack explanations for complex models. To address this, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) AD assessment model that combines hybrid attention with multimodal representations. The model fuses audio, text, and expert knowledge to fully capture intra- and inter-modal interactions, achieving simultaneous AD detection and cognitive state prediction, along with comprehensive explainability analyses of the model and various modalities. Results show that the proposed method is sufficiently sensitive in assessing AD, achieving 89.58% accuracy and 91.67% recall for the classification task and a root mean square error of 4.31 for the regression task with good generalization performance. Multimodal representations with expert knowledge and MTL contribute to AD assessment performance. Explainability analyses indicate that, compared to healthy controls, AD patients exhibit slower speech rates, reduced syntactic complexity, and a greater tendency to use pause fillers and pronouns. Therefore, Our study validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, addressing trust issues in clinical practice for assisted decision-making and further advancing the development of speech as a promising biomarker for early AD screening and cognitive decline monitoring.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are neurodegenerative disorders with overlapping clinical features, making differential diagnosis challenging. The AQEE and GGEE peptides, derived from the proVGF neuroprotein, have emerged as potential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for dementia. Indeed, we previously observed a reduction in AQEE-10 levels using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and GGEE levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in a cohort of DLB patients compared to both controls and AD patients. To better investigate the diagnostic utility of these peptides, we analyzed CSF samples from both the original cohort and a newly recruited cohort. The new cohort (cohort 1) included patients, from Ulm University Hospital, with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and DLB (combined as PDD/DLB; n = 18), and AD (n = 19). The previously analyzed cohort (cohort 2), from the Amsterdam University Medical Center, included DLB (n = 44), AD (n = 20), and cognitively healthy controls (n = 22). AQEE-10 levels were quantified by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in cohort 1 and by ELISA in both cohorts. GGEE levels were measured by ELISA in cohort 1 to corroborate and extend previous findings. MRM-based analysis revealed a significant reduction of AQEE-10 levels in DLB compared to both controls and AD (p < 0.05; ROC-AUC: 78% and 82%, respectively). This finding was confirmed by ELISA, for both AQEE-10 and GGEE peptide levels, along with a positive correlation between their concentrations. These results support AQEE-10 and GGEE as promising peptide biomarkers for distinguishing DLB from other dementia.

OBJECTIVES: The primary endpoint of this study is to establish a reliable SUVR cutoff threshold to distinguish patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), excluding those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), from normal control (NC) individuals using [(18)F]florapronol PET imaging and deep learning-based automated quantification software. The secondary endpoint is to evaluate whether combining partial volume correction (PVC) with SUVR analysis improves diagnostic accuracy in detecting AD. METHODS: A total of 141 participants, including 55 AD patients (excluding MCI) and 86 NC controls, were enrolled. Each participant underwent [(18)F]florapronol PET imaging, and SUVR values were calculated for six amyloid-prone brain regions using deep learning-based software. SUVRs were computed with and without PVC, using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified optimal SUVR thresholds for distinguishing AD (excluding MCI) from NC and for determining visual positivity. Age-matched subgroup analyses ensured consistent diagnostic performance across different age groups. RESULTS: In the full cohort (n = 141), visual analysis achieved a sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 94.1% for distinguishing AD from NC. SUVR without PVC reached a similar sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 86.0% (optimal threshold > 1.26), while PVC-adjusted SUVR further improved accuracy with a sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 94.2% at a threshold of > 1.31. For visual positivity, SUVR without PVC achieved 92.7% sensitivity and 89.5% specificity, while PVC-adjusted SUVR improved these metrics to 96.4% sensitivity and 94.2% specificity. Age-matched analyses confirmed diagnostic consistency across different age groups. The visual analysis and the quantitative analysis using SUVR with PVC as the threshold were consistent in 134 out of 141 subjects (95.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Automated SUVR quantification with PVC adjustment provides a reliable and objective method for distinguishing AD from NC, aligning closely with visual assessment accuracy and supporting clinical use of [(18)F]florapronol PET imaging for AD diagnosis. This standardized approach enhances diagnostic consistency, particularly in settings with limited access to PET specialists, and establishes robust SUVR thresholds for broader clinical application in amyloid PET imaging.

BACKGROUND: Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a rare and recently described neuroinflammatory disease associated with specific autoantibodies. Anti-leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (anti-LGI1) encephalitis is a rare but treatable type of AE discovered in recent years. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disease and the most common cause of dementia. AD may undergo a series of pathological physiological changes in brain tissue 20 years before the onset of typical symptoms. The stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that occurs during this process, known as MCI due to AD, is the earliest stage with clinical symptoms. MCI is typically categorized into two subtypes: Amnestic MCI (aMCI) and non-aMCI. CASE SUMMARY: This report describes a patient with rapid cognitive impairment, diagnosed with anti-LGI1 antibody-mediated AE and aMCI, and treated at Peking University Shenzhen Hospital in March 2023. The patient was hospitalized with acute memory decline for more than 3 months. Both the cerebrospinal fluid and serum were positive for anti-LGI1 antibodies, biomarkers of AD coexisting in the patient's cerebrospinal fluid. Following combination treatment with immunoglobulin therapy and glucocorticoid, plus inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, the patient's cognitive function significantly improved. Throughout the 3-month follow-up period, a sustained improvement in cognitive function was observed. The results of serum anti-LGI1 antibody were negative. CONCLUSION: This case has raised awareness of the possible interaction between AE and early AD (including MCI due to AD), and alerted clinicians to the possibility of concurrent rare and common diseases in patients presenting with cognitive impairment.

BACKGROUND: YouTube is increasingly used by patients and caregivers as a source of health information. However, the quality and reliability of content on Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether YouTube videos on ADD provide reliable and high-quality information for caregivers and to assess whether the most popular videos are also the most trustworthy. METHODS: In December 2024, YouTube was systematically searched for ADD-related videos. Two independent physicians reviewed each video, scoring it using modified DISCERN (mDISCERN) for reliability and the Global Quality Scale (GQS) for content quality. Videos were categorized by goal and assessed for quality, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and specific content. RESULTS: There were 117 videos included in the study. Using the mDISCERN scale, 70 videos (59.8%) were deemed with good reliability, 33 videos (28.2%) have moderate reliability, and 14 videos (12%) have poor reliability. Using the GQS, 61 videos (51.1%) have high quality, 16 videos (28%) were assessed as excellent quality, 34 videos (29%) as moderate quality, and 7 videos (6%) as low quality. Videos from academic institutions, news agency and physicians exhibited higher mDISCERN and GQS scores compared to other groups and a significant correlation was seen between mDISCERN and GQS (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The videos on ADD produced by healthcare professionals and academic institutions have high quality and good reliability, covering disease properties, treatment choices, and patient experiences. However, video popularity does not significantly correlate with content reliability and quality.

OBJECTIVE: Emotion recognition tests are essential for differential diagnostics when assessing patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. However, there remains a lack of emotion recognition tests appropriate for culturally and educationally diverse populations. The aim of this study was to develop an emotion recognition test (the TIE-93) appropriate for these populations. We then examined whether the TIE-93 could reduce emotion recognition performance differences between populations with a native French versus a culturally and educationally diverse background (participants who had immigrated to France). This was assessed by comparing performance between controls of each cultural group. We also assessed the effect of demographic variables on TIE-93 test performance and whether performance in an AD patient group was consistent with the research literature. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with AD dementia and 240 healthy controls, from native French and culturally and educationally diverse backgrounds, were included in the study. The TIE-93 is composed of eight panels with photos of actors displaying six basic emotions. Participants were asked to identify which of the six facial expressions displayed matched an oral description of a context. RESULTS: When comparing French and culturally and educationally diverse controls, Quade's ANCOVA revealed that there remained an effect of culture and education on TIE-93 test performance. Nonetheless, while controlling for years of education, age, sex, and cultural group, patients with AD dementia scored significantly more poorly than controls, specifically for most negative emotions. CONCLUSION: The TIE-93 represents a first step toward developing appropriate emotion recognition tests for culturally and educationally diverse populations.

Dementia and cognitive decline pose significant global public health challenges, with prevalence expected to rise in the coming decades. Lifestyle medicine offers a promising approach to mitigating cognitive issues through six key interventions: diet, physical activity, restorative sleep, social connections, stress management, and avoiding risky substances. Traditional methods like randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have limitations in capturing the long-term impacts of these interventions. To overcome these challenges, the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) and the True Health Initiative (THI) developed the Hierarchies of Evidence Applied to Lifestyle Medicine (HEALM) framework, informed by the Evidence Threshold Pathway Mapping (ETPM) approach. This framework integrates diverse evidence sources to assess intervention effects over time. Applying HEALM, this review evaluates lifestyle factors' impact on dementia and cognitive decline. It finds strong evidence supporting plant-based nutrition, physical activity, restorative sleep, and avoiding risky substances in promoting cognitive health. Social connections may mitigate cognitive decline, while stress management requires further investigation due to inconclusive findings. Integrating these findings into public health strategies could effectively address the growing dementia burden and enhance overall well-being in aging populations, underscoring the need for continued research in cognitive health.

Catatonia is a syndrome combining a variety of psychomotor and behavioral symptoms. It is underdiagnosed in the elderly and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Little is known about the links between catatonia and dementia. We propose a "real-life" case series of five patients with dementia and catatonia, in order to explore the links between catatonia and dementia. Major depression was strongly associated with catatonia in our cases (4/5) and two patients had bipolar disorder. Iatrogenicity was linked to catatonia in three patients, particularly with antipsychotics. Two patients had dementia with Lewy bodies and one was suspected with frontotemporal degeneration. These are the two dementia most frequently associated with catatonia. Catatonia had been mistaken for confusional syndrome in one of our patients. It is important to look for it and treat it in this context.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role alongside clinical and neuropsychological assessments in diagnosing dementia. The recent and ongoing advancements in MRI technology have significantly enhanced the detection and characterization of the specific neurostructural changes seen in various neurodegenerative diseases, thereby significantly increasing the precision of diagnosis. Within this context of perpetual evolution, this review article explores the recent advances in MRI with regard to diagnosing dementia.A retrospective literature review was conducted by searching the PubMed and ScienceDirect databases for the keywords "dementia", "imaging", and "MRI". The inclusion criteria were scientific papers in English that revolved around the role of MRI as a diagnostic tool in the field of dementia. A specific time frame was not determined but the focus was on current articles, with an overall of 20 articles dating from the last 6 years (after 2018), corresponding to 55% of the total number of articles.This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in the radiologic diagnosis of dementia using MRI, with a particular focus on the last 6 years. Technical aspects of image acquisition for clinical and research purposes are discussed. MRI findings typical of dementia are described. The findings are divided into non-specific findings of dementia and characteristic findings for certain dementia subtypes. This provides information about possible causes of dementia. In addition, developed scoring systems that support MRI findings are presented, including the MTA score for Alzheimer's disease with corresponding illustrative figures.The symbiosis of clinical evaluation with high-field MRI methodologies enhances dementia diagnosis and offers a holistic and nuanced understanding of structural brain changes associated with dementia and its various subtypes. The latest advances, mainly involving the emergence of ultra-high-field (7T) MRI, despite having limited use in clinical practice, mark a pragmatic shift in the field of research. · High-field MRI (3T) and specialized sequences allow for the detection of early structural changes indicative of dementia.. · Characteristic neuroanatomical MRI patterns enable the differentiation between various subtypes of dementia.. · Established scales provide added value to the quantification and categorization of MRI findings in dementia.. · Akl E, Dyrba M, Görß D et al.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about travelling and tourism for people living with or caring for someone with dementia. The aim of this scoping review was to synthesise the existing evidence on dementia, travel and tourism, the experiences of people with dementia and their carers, and how venues and businesses are dementia friendly. METHODS: The review protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO [ID: CRD42023397637]. Four databases were searched for relevant literature in February 2024. Studies were included if they were published in English, Danish, or German, without any restrictions on publication date. Titles and abstracts, and full texts, were reviewed by two different research team members, and any disagreements were resolved in discussion with the wider team. RESULTS: From 1,523 screened records, 13 papers were included. Evidence showed wide-ranging barriers for people with dementia and their carers to travel, often limiting the travel to local well-known places with adequate facilities or decisions on whether to travel solo as a carer. Seven studies focused on attitudes of businesses and tourist attractions and their implementations of dementia-friendliness. There was a notable lack of knowledge about dementia, and whilst most sites were willing to adapt existing attractions to include people with dementia, a lack of financial resources was the main barrier consistently referred to. CONCLUSION: Little remains known about the experiences of people living with dementia and their carers surrounding tourism and local, national, and international travel, and how different tourism organisations provide dementia-friendly support. With a focus on supporting people with dementia to remain as independent as possible, research needs to explore the population's experiences, and how tourism destinations and modes of travel and transport could improve to be dementia-friendly and inclusive.

It is important to explore not only what is lost with the progression of dementia, but also what is left and what can be compensated or developed by adapting to the special needs of the conditions. Some studies suggest that as dementia progresses, people become less emotionally expressive and have difficulties in distinguishing between other people's facial expressions. On the other hand, it is also said as cognitive function declines, anger and anxiety increase, placing a burden on caregivers. Here we report the richness of emotions in people with dementia expressed in their interviews. We analysed the transcripts of 88 interviews of people with dementia (4.8 years after diagnosis), which lasted about 60-90 min, sometimes even longer. Those transcripts are valuable, as they show that people with dementia can express themselves verbally for a long time. From the analysis of the transcripts using Paul Ekman's basic emotions, we found that the strongest emotion expressed in the interviews was happiness. We also conducted a survey of the general public recruited through X about the emotions of people with dementia, and found that people without dementia imagined that the strongest emotion felt by people with dementia was fear. Our results suggest that the cognitive abilities and emotional states of people with dementia can be more robust than people without dementia typically perceive. It might be possible to augment happiness-related emotions by the support of those around people with dementia, and the cognitive efforts of the affected people themselves.

PURPOSE: Persons with dementia (PWD) often encounter challenges in effectively managing their medications, which can result in medication deviation. The objective of the current study is to provide references for enhancing the management of medication deviations among PWD. METHOD: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across six databases (PubMed, ProQuest, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP) to identify cross-sectional and cohort studies investigating medication deviations in PWD, published between January 1, 2015, and March 1, 2025. A scoping review methodology was used to summarize and analyze the basic characteristics, assessment tools, types of medication deviations, and influencing factors of included studies. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included. Most used the Beers Criteria(®) or STOPP criteria to assess medication deviations. Risk factors for deviations were categorized into three domains: individual factors (e.g., advanced age, cognitive impairment), caregiver-related factors (e.g., insufficient supervision), and medication-related factors (e.g., polypharmacy). Potentially inappropriate medications were the most prevalent type of deviation, with reported rates ranging from 12.2% to 85%. CONCLUSION: Medication deviations are pervasive in dementia populations. Strengthening medication management protocols-including systematic medication reviews, caregiver education, and multidisciplinary interventions-is critical to reducing adverse drug events and preventable hospital readmissions. Future research should prioritize standardized assessment tools and context-specific strategies tailored to the neurobehavioral complexities of dementia.

Designing effective public health messages is challenging, particularly when communicating complex and relatively new health messages such as dementia risk prevention which are still largely unfamiliar to the public. The accessibility of these messages, especially for individuals who speak English as an additional language, remains uncertain in large scale educational interventions. A key strategy to enhance the communication of evidence-based information is to co-design infographics that optimize the accessibility and impact of visual health messages. This paper reports on the co-design process of infographing dementia prevention messages. Qualitative data were analyzed using reflective thematic analysis to generate three themes reflecting the message design preferences of participants: "all hands on deck," "charting the course," and "get on board." This work supports the crucial need to engage the target audience via co-design when creating visual messages as meaningful and accessible educational tools that will resonate with the intended audience. Doing so may help health communicators navigate the creation of visual messages across diverse health domains and populations.

INTRODUCTION: Lewy body pathology is commonly found in cardiac nervous tissue, including the cardiac conduction system. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) and high-degree atrioventricular block in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementia subtypes. METHODS: We included 73,619 individuals diagnosed with dementia from the Swedish Dementia Registry. Data pertaining to incident pacemaker implantation was obtained from the Swedish Pacemaker Registry. RESULTS: SSS was more common in the DLB compared to the AD cohort (2.2% vs. 1.5%, P = 0.008). In adjusted models, SSS was associated with DLB compared to AD (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval: 1.11-2.01). DISCUSSION: We showed that incident pacemaker implantation secondary to SSS was more common in patients with DLB compared to those with AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Incident pacemaker implantation secondary to sick sinus syndrome (SSS; but not high-degree atrioventricular block [HAVB]) was more common in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) versus Alzheimer's disease (AD).In adjusted models, SSS (but not HAVB) was positively associated with DLB compared to AD.Pacemaker data of various dementia disorders are presented.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common early-onset dementia after Alzheimer's disease, characterized by progressive neurodegeneration primarily in the frontal and temporal lobes. Granulin (GRN) gene for encoding the progranulin (PGRN) protein was a key genetic contributor to FTD. PGRN was a multifunctional protein involved in lysosomal function, neuroinflammation, and neuronal survival. This review discusses the contributions of GRN haploinsufficiency to FTD pathogenesis with an emphasis on genetic mutations, downstream cellular consequences, relevant animal and cellular models, and emerging therapeutic strategies. Loss-of-function mutations in GRN were responsible up to ~50% reduction in PGRN levels, resulting in lysosomal dysfunction, TDP-43 aggregation, impaired microglial homeostasis, and enhanced neuroinflammation. Multiple in vitro and in vivo models recapitulated these pathological features. Novel therapeutic approaches, such as AAV-mediated gene therapy, stop codon readthrough compounds, SORT1 inhibitors, and antisense oligonucleotides, were investigated to restore PGRN levels and to mitigate disease progressions. However, challenges included the oncogenic risks of overexpression and the limited translational success in clinical trials to date. Targeting GRN haploinsufficiency became a promising avenue for FTD therapy. Improved models and refined delivery systems would be essential to develop safe and effective treatments. Future work should also focus on biomarker-guided interventions in presymptomatic mutation carriers.

This article provides an overview of evidence to support a call to action for dementia researchers to ensure that "what matters to people living with dementia" should be at the heart of any decision-making around the choices and design of outcome measures. There have been sufficient reviews observing how the outcome measures that have been used in previous research have not been those that have been valued by people living with dementia or their carers. If researchers continue to use existing measures that are not valued by people living with dementia, they will waste limited research resources by using measures that are not sufficiently sensitive to detect changes that might be attributed to interventions. It is time for researchers to collaborate internationally to ensure that resources are invested in designing and validating new approaches for measurement of psychosocial outcomes for those living with dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: Outcome measures that have been used in previous research have not been those that have been valued by people living with dementia or their carers. Existing outcome measures have been shown not to be fit for purpose and tend to focus on symptom reduction or broad conceptualizations of quality of life. Dementia researchers will need to collaborate internationally to ensure that resources are invested in designing and validating new approaches for measurement of psychosocial outcomes for those living with dementia.

PURPOSE: Routinely listening to personalized music selections has been shown to reduce agitation, the most common symptom of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The purpose of the current study was to assess changes in participant agitation by providing a 6-week personalized music listening (PML) intervention of 30 minutes to 10 nursing home residents with dementia. METHOD: The Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) was administered every 2 weeks throughout the study period. The objective was to see if PML would reduce symptoms of agitation, as measured by participants' CMAI scores. RESULTS: Results from a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance showed improvement in CMAI scores pre- versus post-intervention. Using a Greenhouse-Geisser correction, CMAI score reduction was statistically significant at different time points of the study (F [1.487, 13.886] = 4.63, p = 0.044). CONCLUSION: Results suggest that PML can be an effective and low-cost means for improving dementia-related agitation in the short term.

Objective.This work presents xEEGNet, a novel, compact, and explainable neural network for electroencephalography (EEG) data analysis. It is fully interpretable and reduces overfitting through a major parameter reduction.Approach.As an applicative use case to develop our model, we focused on the classification of common dementia conditions, Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia, versus controls. xEEGNet, however, is broadly applicable to other neurological conditions involving spectral alterations. We used ShallowNet, a simple and popular model in the EEGNet family, as a starting point. Its structure was analyzed and gradually modified to move from a 'black box' model to a more transparent one, without compromising performance. The learned kernels and weights were analyzed from a clinical standpoint to assess their medical significance. Model variants, including ShallowNet and the final xEEGNet, were evaluated using a robust nested-leave-n-subjects out cross-validation for unbiased performance estimates. Variability across data splits was explained using the embedded EEG representations, grouped by class and set, with pairwise separability to quantify group distinction. Overfitting was measured through training-validation loss correlation and training speed.Main results.xEEGNet uses only 168 parameters, 200 times fewer than ShallowNet, yet retains interpretability, resists overfitting, achieves comparable median performance (-1.5%), and reduces performance variability across splits. This variability is explained by the embedded EEG representations: higher accuracy correlates with greater separation between test-set controls and Alzheimer's cases, without significant influence from the training data.Significance.The capability of xEEGNet to filter specific EEG bands, learns band specific topographies and use the right EEG spectral bands for disease classification demonstrates its interpretability. While big deep learning models are typically prioritized for performance, this study shows that smaller architectures like xEEGNet can be equally effective in pathology classification, using EEG data.

BASIC is a new case-finding instrument for cognitive impairment and dementia that has been validated in memory clinics in Denmark and other European countries, and in general practice. The diagnostic accuracy of BASIC for dementia and mild cognitive impairment is like or better than the accuracy of existing, more time-consuming cognitive tests. BASIC is significantly correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment. Education does not affect BASIC, and the effects of age and gender are too small to justify score adjustment. BASIC has similar accuracy when assessing immigrants and native Europeans.

This article aims to explore the integration of Louis Cozolino's (2013) andragogical strategies with the tenets of person-centered dementia care practices to enhance dementia care education. The article examines the multiple dimensions of learning in adulthood, highlighting the role of neural plasticity and lifelong brain adaptation in shaping learning and experiential strategies. This in-depth evaluation underscores the significance of tailoring andragogical approaches to the needs of adult learners, who, in this context, are care providers for persons with dementia. This is done through proper understanding of the neurobiological realities and the unique learning needs of adults. Such tailored approaches can be aligned with the brain's adaptive nature by recognizing the intricate interplay of cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions. Highlighting the need for including lessons on the person-centered approach in dementia care education, the paper argues that adult learners - who are essentially part of the dementia care workforce - first need to learn, appreciate, and embrace the approach before applying it in their caregiving practices. This article presents an overarching argument that integration of Cozolino's principles of adult learning with tenets of person-centered dementia care could provide a robust framework for dementia care education.

Nearly a million people are living with dementia in the UK, and less than 65% of them have been formally diagnosed according to the Alzheimer's Society. Dementia exists on a continuum and people can have mild, moderate or severe symptoms. People with dementia are more likely to experience health problems than people of the same age who do not have dementia. Dementia affects the ability to understand and relate to the world and to manage health conditions. This article discusses how to a person with dementia can be helped to maintain health and enjoy the best possible quality of life.

We present a rare case of elderly-onset anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis combined with underlying Alzheimer dementia, characterized by seronegativity but cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) antibody positivity, which showed a significant improvement following intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. The case highlights serial electroencephalogram (EEG) changes. We focus the discussion on factors contributing to favorable recovery. A 78-year-old woman with Alzheimer's dementia and hypertension experienced rapid onset of further cognitive decline over 1 week, presenting with disorientation, irrelevant speech, and disorganized behaviors. Myoclonus of both upper limbs and focal seizures 10 days later which lead her into intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Test results revealed positive anti-NMDA antibodies in CSF but negative in serum. Serial electroencephalograms (EEG) exhibited extreme delta brush activity transitioning to excess beta activity. Initial treatment with a 5-day course of steroid pulse therapy showed limited efficacy. Subsequently, 5 days of IVIG therapy provided marked improvement in consciousness and cognitive function and also normalized the EEG. This patient presented with severe neurological dysfunction, the need for ICU management, and presence of extreme delta brush EEG pattern. Generally, the prognosis was unfavorable. However, advanced age onset and anti-NMDA antibody positivity in CSF with seronegativity in serum may imply better prognosis. Thus, testing anti-NMDA receptor antibody in both serum and CSF is mandatory and under this complicated situation, timely immunotherapy may be the influencing factors of good prognosis.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight recent findings on the prevalence and risk and protective factors for dementia in Indigenous Peoples, who are disproportionately affected by health inequities driven by social determinants of health and historical injustices. With increasing numbers of Indigenous individuals entering older age, there is a growing need for research to better understand dementia and opportunities for prevention in Indigenous Peoples. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies highlight a wide range of dementia prevalence across Indigenous Peoples, with estimates varying significantly by methodology, socio-cultural context, and region with stark gaps in regional representation. Studies suggested that Indigenous Peoples show distinct profiles of dementia risk factors, including higher rates of cardiovascular disease, lower educational attainment, and socioeconomic disadvantage. However, traditional lifestyles, strong social ties, and culturally grounded practices are suggested to offer protective effects against cognitive decline. SUMMARY: Despite growing research attention, significant limitations remain in understanding dementia in Indigenous Peoples. The available evidence points to the need for culturally sensitive approaches in research and dementia prevention, as well as greater consideration of the social and environmental factors shaping brain health. Future research should aim to incorporate Indigenous knowledge systems and address the social determinants of dementia risk in Indigenous Peoples.

Dementia is the second most feared disease following cancer, and high rates of dementia worry (DW) have been reported in the United States. Personal exposure to dementia (e.g., having a family member with dementia) and subjective cognitive concerns (SCCs) are associated with DW. However, previous studies have focused mainly on older and predominantly non-Hispanic White samples. Nevertheless, personal exposure to dementia is not limited to older adults, and the nature and extent to which DW influences subjective and objective cognition in ethnoracially diverse young adults has not been adequately examined. The present study examined associations among personal exposure to dementia, DW, SCCs, and neuropsychological performance among ethnoracially diverse young adults. Young adults with personal exposure to dementia (M = 20.17, SD = 8.28, n = 48) reported significantly higher DW compared to those without personal exposure (M = 16.83, SD = 6.32, n = 70) (p = .013), and this was especially true for Hispanic/Latino young adults (p = .030). However, DW was not shown to influence SCCs or neuropsychological performance after accounting for depression and anxiety symptoms (ps>.05). Further investigation of associations among personal exposure to dementia, DW, SCCs, and neuropsychological performance in demographically diverse adults is imperative given current estimates and projections for mild cognitive impairment and dementia in our increasingly diversifying aging population.

Background40-60% of people with dementia live with visual impairment. Those with mild-moderate dementia reliably report reduced vision-related quality of life across several visual domains with associated effects on vision-related social functioning. Despite the marked impact on concurrent dementia and visual impairment, no studies have investigated whether the impact of visual impairment on the lived experiences of people with dementia is recognised by their carers.ObjectiveThe present study investigated whether: (1) problems related to vision and vision-related quality of life reported by people with dementia are recognised and acknowledged by their carers and (2) whether currently validated vision-related quality of life measures for mild-moderate dementia are appropriate as proxy measures of vision-related quality of life in this group.MethodsThe 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) and the Visual Activities Questionnaire (VAQ) were completed by 48 participants with mild-moderate dementia and 48 carers. Participants with dementia completed the questionnaires based on their own experiences and carers completed them by proxy (i.e., on behalf of the person with dementia for whom they cared).ResultsThere was good agreement between people with dementia and their carers on both measures overall and on the majority of subscales, with no significant differences between carer and dementia reports.ConclusionsThis provides further support that people with mild-moderate dementia can accurately report their visual experiences, and that carers could provide a valid proxy of the existence and impact of visual impairment on people living with dementia.

Digoxin, a cardiac glycoside and sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor, has a narrow therapeutic index and is primarily prescribed for conditions such as systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation. This narrow window increases the risk of toxicity, especially among susceptible populations. Although digoxin use has declined in recent decades and cases of toxicity have become less frequent, clinicians must remain vigilant, particularly with geriatric patients, who are more susceptible due to polypharmacy and reduced renal function. Here, we present a case of a 77-year-old woman with dementia who exhibited elevated digoxin levels and was successfully treated with digoxin immune Fab. While the use of immune Fab in chronic toxicity cases remains uncertain, our retrospective review of similar cases, managed both with and without immune Fab, provides insights into its role and limitations. We further underscore the importance of regular digoxin monitoring rather than checking the levels only during toxic episodes, as consistent monitoring can prevent fatal cases and reduce overall mortality.

INTRODUCTION: The concept of privacy marks an astonishing gap in the discussion about care for people with dementia (PwD). In general, questions of privacy play an important role and attract much attention in the ethics of nursing care. Yet, when it comes to dementia care, there is hardly any systematic ethical debate on the topic at all. It almost seems as though PwD lost any plausible interest in privacy and no longer had a private sphere that needed to be considered or protected. However, this not only contradicts widespread moral intuitions but also ignores the views and needs of those affected. ARGUMENTS: This conceptual analysis sets out to explore the value of privacy for PwD. We first outline the origins and dimensions of the concept of privacy itself and point out problems and limitations in the context of dementia. Especially the prevalent liberal conceptions' dependence on the idea of individual autonomy poses considerable challenges to an adequate understanding of the moral significance of privacy for PwD. Therefore, we subsequently examine alternative ways of conceptualizing the value of privacy in the context of dementia care. CONCLUSION: We argue that autonomy-based concepts of privacy may still apply in the early stages of dementia. In the further course of the syndrome, however, the relevance of other normative aspects comes to the fore, especially respect for remaining personal preferences as well as objective criteria of dignity and well-being. Thus, we outline in a differentiated way how and to what extent privacy can be of normative importance even beyond the purview of autonomy and should consequently be considered in dementia care.

BackgroundPopulation ageing in Africa will increase the burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias within the next few decades. Despite the potential for discovery of novel genetic risks in African populations, there is still a paucity of dementia genetic research among indigenous Africans.ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of elderly population in Nigeria about dementia and dementia genetics.MethodsOne hundred clinic attendees (aged ≥60 years) recruited at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria were surveyed using an interviewer-administered questionnaire consisting of the Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale (DKAS) and other items assessing knowledge and attitudes about dementia genetics.ResultsThe mean age (±SD) of participants was 71.0 (±7.1) years, and the mean (±SD) DKAS score was 8.87 (±10.84). Only 10% were considered to have good knowledge of dementia (i.e., DKAS score ≥26). Attempts by participants to translate "dementia" in their local languages revealed misleading themes in their perception of the condition. Of the 42 participants who claimed to know what dementia is, 32 (76.2%) of them had poor knowledge (i.e., DKAS <26). Twenty-one participants were aware of the existence of genetic risk factors for dementia, but none could name a dementia risk gene. Seventy participants expressed willingness to undergo genetic testing to assess their risk of dementia.ConclusionsThere is a poor level of knowledge about dementia and dementia genetics among the elderly population in Nigeria. Public health education and community engagement is important for maximizing the impact of dementia genetic studies in Africa.

DNA methylation (DNAm) is a promising biomarker but remains underutilized in routine clinical practice. As an early molecular event, DNAm often occurs before changes in gene expression or protein production, making it valuable for early disease detection. In diabetes, a known risk factor for dementia, changes in DNAm can occur 80-90 days before detectable alterations in protein expression. Furthermore, emerging evidence indicates that DNAm patterns may be present as early as eight years before the onset of dementia. However, DNAm analysis requires specific sample types because methylation is tissue-dependent, and invasive biopsies are often impractical. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) offers a feasible alternative, as it can reflect brain pathology through analysis of DNAm patterns in accessible body fluids. This review explores the mechanisms of dementia-related cfDNA release and detection in cerebrospinal fluid, blood, tears, saliva, and urine, and highlights the broader applications of DNAm beyond early diagnosis. Future research should carefully address tissue specificity in sample selection and focus on developing simplified DNAm assays to facilitate widespread clinical implementation.

OBJECTIVES: Comorbid seizures occur in 2-11 % of frontotemporal dementia(FTD). Despite the high risk for seizures, the risk factors, clinical characteristics, and seizure outcomes in FTD patients with comorbid seizures remain understudied. METHODS: All patients who presented to our hospital from 5/1/2011-4/30/2024 with a clinical diagnosis of FTD were included and subclassified into behavioral-variant FTD(bvFTD), sematic-variant-primary-progressive-aphasia(svPPA), or non-fluent-primary-progressive-aphasia(nfPPA). Demographics, comorbidities, dementia characteristics, and seizure characteristics were obtained from electronic medical records. Patients were classified into those with(FTD+SZ) or without(FTD-SZ) clinically-diagnosed seizures. Seizure outcome was categorized as uncontrolled, controlled on anti-seizure-medications(ASMs), or self-resolving if resolved without ASMs. Data were analyzed using Pearson's Chi-squared, Fisher Exact, or t-tests. RESULTS: Of 317 FTD patients(average age of dementia onset=64.18+9.07years,46.37 % female]), 24(7.6 %) reported seizures. FTD+SZ were more likely to have anxiety(FTD+SZ=7(29.17 %),FTD-SZ= 35(11.95 %),p = 0.0392).Traumatic brain injury(TBI) was the only risk factor for seizures(FTD+SZ=6(25 %),FTD-SZ= 18(6 %),p < 0.001). BvFTD was the most common subtype in FTD+SZ(54.17 %). Focal seizures were more common(50 %) than generalized (29.17 %), with temporal-lobe epilepsy(TLE) being the most common subtype of focal seizures(42 %). Levetiracetam was the most frequently used ASM(38.1 %). Seizures had a favorable prognosis, with 87.5 % achieving seizure control through ASMs, and seizures self-resolving in the rest. FTD+SZ were more likely to be older at death(FTD+SZ=78.63years,FTD-SZ=71.37,p = 0.03966). SIGNIFICANCE: The prevalence of comorbid seizures in FTD at our single-center is 7.6 %. They were most common in bvFTD, primarily focal, with TLE as the predominant subtype. Anxiety was more prevalent with comorbid seizures. Most achieved seizure control on ASMs. FTD+SZ were older at death. These findings address a critical gap, guiding diagnosis, management, and future research.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dementia among Latinos in the United States is growing. We explored the experiences of Latino family caregivers of Latino persons living with moderate to advanced dementia (PLWD), drawing on their extensive experience as caregivers navigating the healthcare system to identify opportunities to improve dementia care. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Nineteen Latino caregivers of PLWD who spoke English or Spanish were recruited from outpatient geriatrics clinics and a home-based primary care program in New York City. METHODS: We conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with family caregivers of PLWD. Interviews were conducted via phone, in-person, or virtual. Interviews were audio recorded, professionally transcribed, translated (if needed), and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: We identified two main themes (each with subthemes) that influence Latino dementia caregiver experiences with healthcare: (1) caregiving and understanding of dementia shaped by individual, family, and social factors (subthemes: Caregiver's own understanding of dementia; Lack of support and understanding from family; Latino cultural perspectives on dementia); and (2) navigating formal services amid gaps in cultural alignment and support (subthemes: Trial and error: education and resource gaps; Cultural tension with healthcare). CONCLUSIONS: Culture and family dynamics shape Latino family caregivers' understanding of dementia. Although some had positive experiences, most faced challenges navigating healthcare and experienced gaps in culturally concordant information and support. A culturally centered approach is needed to address these challenges and gaps for the Latino dementia community, including culturally relevant education, resources, and support from the healthcare system and community.

INTRODUCTION: Cognitive reserve (CR) is a multidimensional construct based on lifelong engagement in cognitively stimulating domains, including education, occupation and leisure activities, that plays a crucial role in mitigating the presentation of dementia. To date, the contribution of each CR subdomain in the development of dementia is under-investigated. This study is aimed at assessing the association of CR subdomains with cognitive status, accounting for sex and age in an old-age population. METHODS: 317 older adults were recruited with a diagnosis of subjective cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or mixed-type dementia. Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq) was used to assess CR. Patients were stratified based on sex and dementia staging (CDR). Significant variables from univariate analysis entered a multivariate ordinal regression model, using CDR as the dependent variable. RESULTS: The results showed that the leisure activities subdomain was the main determinant of cognitive status (OR 0.90, 95%CI 0.82-1.00, p = 0.003); CR and sex did not show any interaction. DISCUSSION: Unlike education and occupation, leisure activities may be considered a lifelong, dynamic contributor to CR. These findings highlight the importance of refining CR assessment, with particular attention to leisure activities as a potentially modifiable target for dementia prevention.

INTRODUCTION: Blue spaces (i.e., water bodies) may benefit cognitive health depending on their uses and surrounding spatial context. We examined associations between blue spaces and incident dementia in the Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study, and specifically within Pittsburgh, given its industrial uses of blue spaces. METHODS: Participants were 2924 adults (Pittsburgh: n = 651) ≥65 years of age. Dementia was clinically adjudicated (1992-1999). Water density was measured using both 1 km radial buffers and U.S. Census tracts. RESULTS: In Pittsburgh only, greater buffer-level blue space predicted a higher risk of mixed/vascular dementia (highest vs lowest tertile: hazard ratio [HR] = 2.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.43-5.74), but not Alzheimer's disease (p > 0.05). This was attenuated adjusting for individual/neighborhood confounders (HR = 2.65, 95% CI: 0.99-7.07). Tract-level associations were attenuated but significant after adjustment. DISCUSSION: Blue space was related to vascular dementia risk after accounting for social context and using more personalized buffer-level measures. Future studies should carefully consider spatial units and differentiate blue spaces by historical uses. HIGHLIGHTS: Examined associations between nearby blue spaces and incident dementia. Tested multiple spatial units (buffer, tract) and separately for the Pittsburgh site. Blue space density was not related to dementia risk in overall sample. Greater blue space density predicted a higher risk of dementia for the Pittsburgh site. Associations were attenuated after adjusting for neighborhood confounders.

BackgroundCurrent physical activity literature does not distinguish between young (dementia diagnosed before 65) and late onset dementia despite differences between these groups such as age, being known to influence physical activity levels.ObjectiveThe primary aim was to compare objective physical activity levels between people with young onset dementia, late onset dementia, and age-matched control participants without dementia.MethodsThis cross-sectional analysis included four groups (young onset dementia [n = 23]; young onset control [n = 782]; late onset dementia [n = 30]; late onset control [n = 918]) of participants aged 49 to 76 (56% male) from the UK Biobank. Objective light intensity physical activity, moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep were measured using 7-day wrist-worn accelerometry.ResultsPeople with young onset dementia did more light and moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity than those with late onset dementia, with these differences becoming nonsignificant when controlling for age. There were no significant differences between people with young onset dementia and the young onset control group. Comparatively, people with late onset dementia did less light intensity physical activity and spent more time sedentary and sleeping than the late onset control group.ConclusionsThis study highlights the distinct physical activity levels of people with young onset and late onset dementia. Future physical activity research should distinguish between young onset and late onset dementia. Such an approach will be important for producing findings that are more applicable for individuals diagnosed with dementia at all stages of life.

The advent of amyloid-targeting therapies and biomarker-based risk stratification has transformed the understanding of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. These conditions are now recognized as chronic, detectable and modifiable, often presenting decades before clinical symptoms appear. While this paradigm shift enables earlier intervention, it also raises ethical and psychological challenges that necessitate a redefined role for psychiatry. Instead of merely supporting late-stage care, psychiatry is well-placed to facilitate risk communication, promote resilience, and encourage adaptive behavior in individuals navigating preclinical or prodromal neurodegeneration. This article outlines an ethical, stepwise communication framework, clarifies the distinction between diagnosis and probabilistic risk, and explores psychiatric contributions-from motivational models to lifestyle-based prevention-that bridge the gap between biological insight and subjective experience. By reinterpreting risk as a chance for intervention rather than resignation, psychiatry broadens the therapeutic scope and helps safeguard independence, dignity and quality of life-making it a pivotal participant in dementia prevention and individualized, person-centered care.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can increase vulnerability to neurodegenerative disorders. The association between TBI and dementia has been previously reported, but studies have relied on self-reporting of TBI and often do not appropriately adjust for relevant risk factors or cover enough time to include both individuals at age of highest TBI risk and age of dementia onset. This study uses electronic health records, which include over 20 years of data and 1.7 million individuals with hospital or general practitioner diagnoses of dementia and TBI. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the association between TBI and dementia and between TBI and dementia subtypes (Alzheimer disease [AD], vascular dementia [VaD], and unspecified dementia). METHODS: We performed a population-based study using Welsh (UK) electronic health records to estimate effect of TBI on the risk of dementia for individuals aged between 30 and 65 years in 1999 without a previous dementia diagnosis. The long-term risk of dementia after TBI was established using Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for sex, social deprivation, and other comorbidities. The effect of the time between TBI and dementia was investigated with time-stratified analyses. We assessed separately the risks of AD, VaD, and unspecified dementia related to TBI. RESULTS: Our study investigated 42,974 individuals with dementia (mean diagnosis age of 70 [SD = 10.5]), 10,164 individuals with a history of TBI, and 1,737,480 controls (mean age of 62 [SD = 11.9]). 49% of all individuals were female. TBI was associated with increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.32, 95% CI [1.88-2.85], p = 3.8 × 10(-15)), with the risk increasing for multiple TBIs (HR = 1.22, 95% CI [1.08-1.38], p = 1.8 × 10(-03)). The effect size of association between TBI and dementia was higher in people diagnosed with VaD (HR = 1.71, 95% CI [1.06-2.75], p = 0.027) and unspecified dementia (HR = 1.90, 95% CI [1.29-2.80], p = 0.0011) compared with the AD group (HR = 1.44, 95% CI [0.84-2.48], p = 0.189). DISCUSSION: Our study confirms that TBI increases dementia risk. We have shown a higher risk of VaD and unspecified dementia in those with a TBI, compared with AD. This study will direct future research into which biological mechanisms drive the association between TBI and dementia.

Dementia, one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, affects millions worldwide. Understanding linguistic markers of dementia is crucial for elucidating how cognitive decline manifests in speech patterns. Current non-invasive assessments like the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) tests rely on manual interpretation and often lack detailed linguistic insight. This paper introduces a first-of-its-kind interpretable artificial intelligence (IAI) framework, CharMark, which leverages first-order Markov Chain models to characterize language production at the character level. By computing steady-state probabilities of character transitions in speech transcripts from individuals with dementia and healthy controls, we uncover distinctive character-usage patterns. The space character " ", representing pauses, and letters such as "n" and "i" showed statistically significant differences between groups. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed natural clustering aligned with cognitive status, while Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests confirmed distributional shifts. A Lasso Logistic Regression model further demonstrated that these character-level features possess strong discriminative potential. Our primary contribution is the identification and characterization of candidate linguistic biomarkers of cognitive decline; features that are both interpretable and easily computable. These findings highlight the potential of character-level modeling as a lightweight, scalable strategy for early-stage dementia screening, particularly in settings where more complex or audio-dependent models may be impractical.

BACKGROUND: Technology is becoming a popular and cost-effective way of supporting people living with dementia. Despite this, uptake and adherence to technology interventions is variable. Two factors contributing to this are people's pre-existing attitudes towards technology which influence how accepted interventions are, and how accessible technologies are to use. Attitudes and accessibility are developed through people's everyday experiences of technology which are underexplored in research. METHOD: This study used photo-elicitation interviews to explore ten people living with dementia's experiences of using everyday technology and dementia-specific technology. Experiences were explored in and outside the home environment to understand experience at an individual and societal level. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to understand how technologies are experienced, and how these experiences might contribute to the acceptability and accessibility of technologies supporting people living with dementia. FINDINGS: Four overarching findings were formed from the data: 1) Impact of symptoms of dementia on technology use, 2) Motivation to use technology, 3) The importance of integrating appropriate technology, and 4) The importance of setting in technology implementation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that technologies are a desirable method of providing support to many people living with dementia if the correct tailoring and support is given. People living with dementia are motivated to use technology for various reasons, but interventions that enhance existing face-to-face services, rather than replace them maybe more accepted. Finally, people living with dementia are hopeful that technology will help future generations because these individuals will begin their dementia journey already equipped with the confidence and skills to manage more complex technologies effectively.

The present study assessed whether dementia worry is associated with adults' subjective cognitive difficulties, and whether any associations are moderated by age. Participants were 477 adults aged 18-90 years. They completed standard, subjective measures of dementia worry and everyday cognitive difficulties (i.e. attention, language, verbal and visual-spatial memory, and visual-perceptual ability). Moderated regression analyses included dementia worry as a predictor of specific cognitive difficulties, and age as a moderator. Covariates included gender, trait cognitive and somatic anxiety, general aging-related anxiety, depression, stress, mental health treatment status, and health status. Greater overall dementia worry, and specifically more frequent dementia worry, were both associated with greater attentional difficulty in middle-aged and older adults, but not in young adults. Cognitions about developing dementia in reaction to memory lapses were also associated with greater cognitive difficulties across the adult lifespan for multiple cognitive domains. Results highlight a robust relationship between dementia worry and subjective attentional difficulties, especially in middle-aged and older adults. Worry frequency is also more influential with adult aging. A cognitive or meta-cognitive mechanism may underlie subjective cognitive concerns across the adult lifespan.

OBJECTIVES: While caregivers are typically enmeshed in broad networks of family and friends assisting with care, this network has been neglected in favor of examining a "primary" caregiver. This study examines types of family and unpaid friend networks for individuals with dementia and how one's network type relates to the well-being of care recipients with dementia and their caregivers. METHODS: Data are drawn from the nationally representative 2017 National Health and Aging Trends Study and associated National Study of Caregiving. The sample includes 336 dementia care networks (network size mean = 2.9). We first identified network types using latent class analysis and then examined the extent to which network type is associated with the well-being of care recipients with dementia (sleep, depressive symptoms) and their caregivers (emotional difficulty, overload, social support from family and friends) using ANOVA and linear regressions adjusting for demographics. RESULTS: 3 network types were identified: "Siloed"-small networks, limited task sharing (29.8% of networks); "Small but Mighty"-small networks, high task sharing (23.0% of networks); and "Complex"-large networks, diverse membership, members who share and specialize in task assistance (47.2%). Individuals with dementia with a "Siloed" network had significantly poorer sleep quality and caregivers in "Siloed" networks reported receiving less social support from family and friends than those in "Small but Mighty" and "Complex" networks. DISCUSSION: Caregiver networks that are less collaborative may need supports to reduce isolation among caregivers and improve health outcomes for individuals with dementia.

While science is the same in the East and West, certain personal characteristics may distort scientific results. This is more likely in the East. An example may be a recent project in the East that measured the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease dementia in a very large group. They found it to be near 1%, which seems very low. Studies that show a low prevalence of Alzheimer's disease dementia could be due to an examination of a very healthy group with very few older people, and/or poor/inaccurate testing (none of which were in this study). Another possibility is that the person, their family or their doctor aim at ignoring or hiding a diagnosis of dementia.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers can directly reflect physiological and pathological changes within the central nervous system, serving as a critical element in the preliminary diagnosis and disease monitoring of central nervous system disorders. Specific CSF biomarker patterns may be associated with different types of dementia. The goal of this analysis is to scrutinize the causal correlation between 338 CSF biomarkers and the danger of 4 dementia categories, namely Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies, using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Forward and reverse MR were employed to examine this causal relationship. Inverse variance weighting was used as the primary statistical method, with weighted median, MR-Egger, simple mode, and weighted mode methods as supplementary approaches. Concurrently, scrutiny of horizontal pleiotropy, heterogeneity, and sensitivity was undertaken to substantiate the inferences made from the MR study. We identified 9 positive and 12 negative causal relationships between genetic predisposition to CSF biomarkers and dementia. Notably, a bidirectional causal relationship was found between 3-methoxytyrosine levels and Alzheimer disease. The findings of this MR study support a causal association between CSF biomarkers and the risk of 4 distinct types of dementia.

BACKGROUND: The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a "Dementia Game" in increasing awareness and improving attitudes towards dementia among the general public in Singapore. The game requires players to navigate a path and respond to questions related to misconceptions about dementia. METHODS: Using a quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test design, 138 participants completed questionnaires before and after playing the digital game to assess changes in their attitudes towards dementia. The Attitudes towards Dementia Questionnaire (ADQ) was used to measure overall attitudes as well as the "hope" and "person-centred" subscales. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were conducted to determine if there were statistically significant changes in ADQ scores from pre-test to post-test. Subgroup analyses were also performed to investigate differences based on participants' prior experience with dementia. RESULTS: Participants showed statistically significant improvements in their overall attitudes towards dementia, as well as in the "hope" and "person-centred" subscales, after playing the game. However, those who had prior experience working with people with dementia or had received dementia training did not show significant improvements. DISCUSSION: The study demonstrates the potential of a digital game to promote public awareness and improve attitudes towards dementia. The interactive and educational features of the game were well-received by participants, suggesting it can be an effective tool for challenging stereotypes and stigma surrounding dementia. However, the lack of significant improvements among those with prior dementia experience or training may reflect a ceiling effect, as they likely had higher baseline knowledge and less room for improvement. Future research should explore the long-term impacts of the game and compare its effectiveness to other interventions, potentially using a randomised controlled trial design.

BACKGROUND: Media coverage shapes public perceptions of dementia. However, visual representation remains unexplored. This study examines how dementia is portrayed in Finnish news media. METHODS: Visual thematic analysis with quantification was conducted on 255 images published between 2018 and 2021 in Finland's four most-read national tabloids. RESULTS: Media portrayals were predominantly negative and stereotypical, emphasising ageing, dependency and anxiety. People with dementia were mainly depicted as older, with grey hair, wrinkled hands and as individuals in need of assistance. Representations lacked diversity in terms of gender, ethnicity and experiences of dementia in daily life. DISCUSSION: Newspaper images often reinforce stigmatising views of dementia by depicting dementia exclusively as ageing and dependency. Media should use more diverse and accurate visuals to reduce stigma and promote a more inclusive and realistic understanding of dementia.

OBJECTIVE: The 2024 Alzheimer's Association (AA) research diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) considers fluid biomarkers, including promising blood-based biomarkers for detecting AD. This study aims to identify dementia subtypes and their cognitive and neuroimaging profiles in older adults with dementia in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) using biomarkers and clinical data. METHODS: Forty-five individuals with dementia over 65 years old were evaluated using the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia and the informant-based Alzheimer's Questionnaire. Core AD biomarkers (Aβ42/40 and p-tau181) and non-specific neurodegeneration biomarkers (NfL, GFAP) were measured in blood plasma. Neuroimaging structures were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dementia subtypes were determined based on plasma biomarker pathology and vascular markers. Biomarker cutoff scores were identified to optimize sensitivity and specificity. Individuals were stratified into one of four dementia subtypes-AD only, non-AD vascular, non-AD other, or mixed - based on combinations of abnormalities in these markers. RESULTS: Among the 45 individuals with dementia, mixed dementia had the highest prevalence (42.4%), followed by AD-only (24.4%), non-AD other dementia (22.2%), and non-AD vascular dementia subtypes (11.1%). Both cognitive and neuroimaging profiles aligned poorly with biomarker classifications in the full sample. Cognitive tests varied across dementia subtypes. The cognitive profile of the AD-only and mixed groups suggested relatively low cognitive performance, while the non-AD and other groups had the best scores on average. CONCLUSION: Consistent with studies in other settings, our preliminary findings suggest that neurodegenerative plasma biomarkers may help to identify dementia subtypes and provide insight into cognitive and neuroimaging profiles among older adults in the DRC.

Background and Objectives: The connection between cognitive decline and autonomy represents a complex and multifactorial area of research. Cognitive decline manifests as a progressive impairment of higher mental functions and is typical of neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia. Autonomy, on the other hand, is defined as an individual's ability to independently manage activities of daily living and make informed decisions. The objective of this study was to investigate whether certain daily living skills can persist despite the advancement of dementia, and what factors contribute to their preservation in maintaining autonomy. Materials and Methods: A literature review was conducted using the databases PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Embase, and PsycInfo. Out of an initial pool of 12,113 studies, only 19 met the inclusion criteria and were selected for analysis. Results: The findings indicate that, in non-institutionalized settings, some daily living abilities may remain preserved despite cognitive deterioration. In contrast, within institutionalized environments, a significant correlation emerged between cognitive decline and the progressive loss of personal autonomy. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of assessing residual abilities in individuals with dementia. Recognizing and supporting these remaining skills can play a crucial role in enhancing quality of life, delaying institutionalization, and promoting autonomy even in the presence of advanced cognitive decline.

Stigma surrounding dementia is a significant issue affecting individuals and communities leading to discrimination towards those living with the condition. However, the changing paradigm in dementia support to living well with dementia can reduce this stigma and improve community attitudes. A community initiative aimed to address this evaluated the impact of a two-hour education forum involving 92 community members. Presentations from experts, including a person with dementia, addressed dementia-related human rights issues and initiatives to live well with dementia. Attendees completed the new Dementia Community Attitudes Questionnaire (DCAQ) aligned with the evolving paradigm of living well with dementia before and after the forum. Participants with prior dementia education had higher initial scores while those without education showed more significant improvements. Almost all DCAQ items showed post-forum score improvements. This community Dementia Awareness Raising Forum provided an opportunity for people to come together and initiate conversations around dementia resulting in more positive community attitudes.

OBJECTIVES: Socioeconomic inequalities in oral health and dementia exist worldwide. This study investigated the mediating effects of tooth loss on the association between income and dementia. METHODS: This study used data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study, which targeted people aged ≥65 years. The explanatory variable was equivalent income in 2010. The outcome variable was dementia incidence between 2010 and 2022. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to examine the association between income and dementia incidence, adjusting for confounders. We performed causal mediation analyses to evaluate the extent to which the number of natural teeth mediates the association. RESULTS: Among the 21,306 participants, the mean age was 73.4 years, and 53.5 % were females. The cumulative incidence of dementia was 19.7 % for people with higher incomes and 24.0 % for those with lower incomes. People with lower incomes had fewer teeth (the prevalence of having ≥20 teeth: 42.2 % in higher incomes and 31.1 % in lower incomes). Lower income was associated with dementia after adjusting for confounders (Hazard ratio (HR) [95 % confidence interval (CI)]: 1.18 [1.10; 1.26]), which was partially attenuated by controlling for the number of teeth (HR [95 % CI]: 1.17 [1.09; 1.25]). Causal mediation analysis demonstrated that the proportion mediated by the number of teeth was 6.6 %. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that tooth loss partially mediated the association between income and dementia. Preventing tooth loss appears to reduce inequalities in dementia among older people. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Tooth loss has mediating effects on the association between income and dementia. Strategies for maintaining natural teeth seem effective in reducing the socioeconomic inequalities of dementia.

Cultural narratives about dementia reinforce the idea that people living with the condition are unreliable narrators of their own experiences. Challenges with recall and memory and changes in language that are commonly experienced by people living with dementia become equated to a loss of self. Since language is a shared space where people construct meaning through stories, stories that lack coherence or exhibit broken language are often discounted. To counter the notion that broken narratives reveal broken selves, I present a story by Marlene, a person living with dementia who recalled an encounter with a bobcat while on a camping trip. Rather than considering the veracity of her story, I focus on the importance of the emotions presented-the feeling self. Overall, I argue that by shifting focus from story challenges to expressed emotions, we are better positioned to understand and respect people living with dementia as authorities of their own experiences.

The lived experience of dementia, the views of the caregiver, and the pursuit of scientific understanding by researchers need to converge for holistic and collaborative action to improve dementia research. However, there often exist silos and division between these groups, which limits relevance and innovation. This paper aims to bridge this divide by offering a tripartite exploration of dementia research through three distinct, yet interconnected, lenses of a person living with the disease, their dedicated carer, and a researcher actively engaged in dementia research. This collaborative endeavour highlights the need to move beyond the traditional (and outdated) dichotomy of "subject and expert". By weaving together personal perspectives and insights in a multi-voiced approach, we highlight the opportunities and potential that can emerge from working in partnership and using a relational approach.

Being the second most-frequent type of age-related neurodegenerative dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is currently exerting a huge burden on the healthcare system. Since DLB lacks a definitive biomarker profile, a diagnostic tool becomes indispensable for effectively distinguishing DLB from other neurodegenerative diseases with overlapping neuropathological and clinical features in their early stages. In this context, saliva could serve as a viable alternative to more invasive and costly methods, providing clear advantages in terms of safety and affordability. This is a commentary serving to contextualize the findings of D'Antonio et al., featured in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia and hearing loss pose a substantial global health challenge, and understanding their association is crucial. This study aims to determine the prevalence of hearing loss in dementia patients and investigate the risk factors for dementia severity including hearing loss. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional study. Patients with dementia diagnosed by a psychiatrist or neurologist were invited to participate in this study. Audiometry and tympanometry were performed for hearing investigation. The severity of dementia was determined by the Thai Mental State Examination questionnaire, and the SD-SLP-01 aphasia screening questionnaire and associate factors were collected. RESULTS: A total of 88 participants were included in the study. Two participants withdrew because they were unable to complete hearing tests. The prevalence of hearing loss in this study was 94.2%. The prevalence of aphasia was 25.6%. The most common type of hearing loss is sensorineural hearing loss. Twenty-five percent of participants had moderate to severe hearing loss. A statistically significant difference was observed in the mean Thai Mental State Examination scores across different degrees of hearing loss (p = 0.040). The factors that contributed to the severity of dementia included aphasia (OR: 14.40, 95% CI: 4.53-45.73, p < 0.001) and severe hearing loss (OR: 55.00, 95% CI: 0.83-3,650.97, p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed an extremely high prevalence of hearing loss in the dementia population. Furthermore, a statistically significant association was observed between severe hearing loss and dementia.

Understanding how to improve the physical and cognitive accessibility of visitor economy businesses and organisations wanting to offer nature-based outdoor pursuits for people with dementia is key to supporting their inclusion and agency. The aim of this qualitative study was to understand the experiences, needs and preferences of people with dementia participating in nature-based outdoor pursuits in their leisure time. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 people with dementia and 15 family members and subjected to thematic analysis. Four themes related to inclusion for people with dementia and their family members reflected diversity in individual needs and preferences for engaging with nature-based outdoor pursuits, their own adaptations to maintain access including accommodating risk, how cognitive and physical accessibility can be supported by businesses, and which practical and psychosocial barriers prevent inclusion. Learning from people with dementia and their family members has helped bridge the gap to their inclusion in nature-based outdoor pursuits. Their insights will inform the development of such pursuits by businesses and organisations as well as future work into risk decision-making.

Within the dominant U.S. cultural imagination, dementia care is often constructed as a significant physical, mental, emotional, and financial burden, with a huge cost to individuals, families, and society. This cultural anxiety positions dementia as a signifier of dependence, helplessness, frailty, and loss. However, feminist disability studies offers a way to approach dementia and care as relational, collective, and political. Drawing on nine months of ethnographic research in the dementia unit of a nursing home, I illustrate how dementia care is a site of collectivity, resistance, and activism in a context of exploitation, control, and oppression. I uncover how institutionalized old women with dementia and immigrant and nonimmigrant women of color care workers navigate strict institutional routines, pressures of time management, and tightly controlled, predetermined care tasks and how they withstand these forces by making time for and giving time to one another, continuously (re)building relationships and investing in collective care that emphasizes interdependence.

INTRODUCTION: DREAMS-START is a multicomponent intervention targeting sleep disturbance in people with dementia. To enhance understanding of the DREAMS-START randomised controlled trial, which showed improved sleep in the intervention compared to the control arm, we conducted a process evaluation exploring (i) DREAMS-START delivery, (ii) behaviour change mechanisms and (iii) contextual factors impacting outcomes. METHODS: Mixed-methods design. We measured intervention adherence, fidelity and additional therapeutic process measures. We interviewed a sub-sample of intervention arm family carers and facilitators delivering DREAMS-START. We analysed data thematically guided by a prespecified theory of change logic model informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework. We measured movement using an actigraph worn by the person with dementia at baseline and at four- and eight-month follow-ups to explore potential mechanisms of action. RESULTS: Attendance was good (82.8% attended ≥4/6 sessions). Mean fidelity score (95.4%; SD 0.08) and median score for all four process measures assessed (5/5; IQR 5-5) were high. We interviewed 43/188 family carers and 9/49 DREAMS-START facilitators. We identified three overarching themes aligned with our model: (i) knowledge and facilitation enable behaviour change, (ii) increasing sleep pressure and developing skills to manage sleep disturbances and (iii) Establishing a routine and sense of control. We were unable to collect sufficient data for pre-specified actigraphy analyses. CONCLUSION: Despite competing demands, carers attended DREAMS-START. It promoted behaviour change through supportive in-session reflection, increasing carer knowledge and skills. This was embedded between sessions and actions were positively reinforced as carers experienced changes. Results will inform future implementation in clinical services.

Conversations about dependency must balance competing concerns too often consolidated into opposing narratives. On the one hand, our cultural premium on autonomy casts dependency as a weakness and a tragedy, if not a moral failing. On the other hand, efforts to resist this dominant narrative reframe dependency as the rule and not the exception. Extending this delicate balancing act to emerging modalities of dementia care poses additional questions. What should we make of apparently increasing levels of dependence on technology, as opposed to on humans? Confronting both the technophobic and technophilic extremes at once--alongside the polarized views of dependency that underlie them--provides us with clearer resources for reformulating narratives about technology in dementia care. What we need is an account of dependence that recognizes its ubiquity and moral significance while also acknowledging that it requires work that is widely devalued and that can exacerbate vulnerabilities.

IntroductionCurrent support programs for individuals with dementia focus primarily on patients living with caregivers. Research on individuals with dementia living alone is sparse, with small sample sizes. This report describes data collected from the Supportive Care for Dementia program. The program's goals are to provide support services that allow the person to remain in their residence, increase involvement and decrease the stress experienced by family members, reduce neurobehavioral disturbances, reduce hospitalizations and emergency room visits and related costs, and facilitate placement or caregiving support when appropriate.MethodsThe data were collected from 300 patients enrolled in the Supportive Care for Dementia program. Measurements included patient behaviors, distant caregiver stress, hospitalizations and emergency room visits, and provided services.ResultsProgram participation was associated with positive outcomes, including decreased emergency room visits, decreased distant caregiver stress, and increased supportive services and familial engagement. Demographic data including racial and ethnic differences are discussed.DiscussionThe Supportive Care for Dementia program is a replicable program with demonstrated positive outcomes for individuals with dementia living alone.

Metaphors to describe and understand dementia have been used in Western culture for many years. However, the ways in which people living with dementia and care partners use metaphors and symbols to illustrate and give meaning to their own experiences has been less understood. In this paper we explore the use of metaphor as methodology-- a way to support people living with dementia and their care partners in reflecting on and sharing their experiences of dementia. More specifically, drawing on our experiences using metaphor and symbols to map out the dementia journey from the perspectives of people living with dementia, care partners, and health and social care providers in Ontario, Canada, we describe our process of employing metaphor as methodology. We reflect on the use of metaphor as methodology through framing the dementia experience, exploring complexity, and representing multidimensionality. The use of metaphors has the potential to open space for new understandings of dementia.

INTRODUCTION: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods enhance the diagnostic efficiency of clinical decision support systems by making the predictions of a convolutional neural network's (CNN) on brain imaging more transparent and trustworthy. However, their clinical adoption is limited due to limited validation of the explanation quality. Our study introduces a framework that evaluates XAI methods by integrating neuroanatomical morphological features with CNN-generated relevance maps for disease classification. METHODS: We trained a CNN using brain MRI scans from six cohorts: ADNI, AIBL, DELCODE, DESCRIBE, EDSD, and NIFD (N=3253), including participants that were cognitively normal, with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Clustering analysis benchmarked different explanation space configurations by using morphological features as proxy-ground truth. We implemented three post-hoc explanations methods: i) by simplifying model decisions, ii) explanation-by-example, and iii) textual explanations. A qualitative evaluation by clinicians (N=6) was performed to assess their clinical validity. RESULTS: Clustering performance improved in morphology enriched explanation spaces, improving both homogeneity and completeness of the clusters. Post hoc explanations by model simplification largely delineated converters and stable participants, while explanation- by-example presented possible cognition trajectories. Textual explanations gave rule-based summarization of pathological findings. Clinicians' qualitative evaluation highlighted challenges and opportunities of XAI for different clinical applications. CONCLUSION: Our study refines XAI explanation spaces and applies various approaches for generating explanations. Within the context of AI-based decision support system in dementia research we found the explanations methods to be promising towards enhancing diagnostic efficiency, backed up by the clinical assessments.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare group of disorders characterized by elevated eosinophil levels, leading to tissue infiltration and damage. Neurological complications are observed in over half of the patients. This case study discusses a 45-year-old male patient diagnosed with HES and rapidly progressive dementia. The patient presented with difficulties in routine tasks, attention deficits, memory loss, and frontal headaches lasting one year. His medical history included allergic rhinitis and eczematoid skin lesions. General and neurological examinations revealed deficits in higher mental functions without other abnormalities. Laboratory tests showed significant eosinophilia, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain indicated diffuse cortical atrophy and periventricular hyperintensities. The diagnosis of HES was supported by clinical and laboratory findings. The case highlights the importance of considering HES in patients with unexplained neurological symptoms and eosinophilia to prevent irreversible organ damage. Early recognition and appropriate management are crucial for improving patient outcomes. This study underscores the need for further research to understand HES's pathophysiology and develop targeted therapies.

Objectives: Dementia preventive strategies might benefit from a comprehensive approach that considers the interplay of biological and social factors. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of dementia by sex and age in a cohort of individuals with cardiovascular risk factors, and to assess how sociodemographic and clinical factors are associated with this disease. Methods: Cross-sectional study was conducted on ≥55-year-old individuals from the CARhES (CArdiovascular Risk factors for HEalth Services research) Spanish cohort. Real-world data on sociodemographic, clinical, and drug information was obtained. Dementia cases were identified by diagnoses and pharmacological treatment. Age- and sex-stratified logistic regression models and sex-stratified CTree analyses were used. Results: The prevalence of dementia among the 323,973 individuals in the cohort was 5.2%, 3.4% in men and 6.6% in women, and it increased with age. In both sex groups, stroke and depression were associated with a higher prevalence of dementia for all the age groups, while sex differences were found in the association of the rest of the sociodemographic and clinical variables with dementia. Being older and with lower socioeconomic status were the most predictive factors of dementia prevalence. Stroke was a stronger indicator in men than in women, while hypertension was nearly twice as significant in women. Conclusions: The prevalence of dementia in people with cardiovascular risk factors was 5.2%, similar to that of the general population. Besides age, having a lower socioeconomic level was the most important indicator of dementia, which may justify more resources and care for these populations.

Dementia is a growing global public health concern, particularly in LMICs like Bangladesh. With population aging, there is an increasing prevalence of dementia; care facilities are limited. This scarcity of services places a significant responsibility on untrained family caregivers, impacting the health of persons with dementia and their caregivers. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving dementia care, especially in resource-constrained settings. Recognizing the urgency, the WHO developed an online self-training manual, iSupport, emphasizing education, skill development, and support for caregivers. This study aims to test feasibility of iSupport i) in improving knowledge about dementia and dementia care among family and formal caregivers, and ii) reducing family caregivers' stress and improving their caregiving skills, mental health, quality of life and relationship with the person with dementia cared for. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of SAJIDA Foundation (2024-005-SFIRB). This non-randomized feasibility study aims to recruit 44 family caregivers and 132 formal caregivers from Dhaka, Bangladesh, using a purposive sampling technique. Participants will be provided access to iSupport for two months. Pre- and post-intervention surveys will be conducted to assess changes in knowledge about dementia care among both family and formal caregivers, as well as changes in psychological well-being among family caregivers. To assess knowledge retention, a follow-up survey will be conducted. Any differences in the outcomes from the pre-intervention period will be tested against the null hypothesis of zero mean difference using a two-sample paired t-test. Additionally, multivariable regression techniques will also be used to control for possible confounders. To understand the facilitators and barriers of implementing iSupport, a qualitative approach will be used to interview 15 family caregivers and conduct four FGDs with formal caregivers. Qualitative data will be analysed using an inductive content analysis approach.

AIM: Pain is under-assessed and under-treated among people living with dementia. This study aims to explore the perspectives of people with dementia, family carers, and healthcare professionals regarding their experiences and needs for pain assessment and management. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive approach. METHODS: Between May and August 2023, people with early-stage dementia (n = 6), their family carers (n = 7), and healthcare professionals (n = 10) from four Australian states participated in semi-structured interviews, online or by telephone. Most of the participants were female. Work experience of healthcare professionals and caring experience of carers ranged from 3-40 and 2-8 years, respectively. Following transcription, the data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four main themes and 10 subthemes were identified. Main themes were (1) communications to identify pain in people with dementia, (2) pain assessment in people with dementia, (3) pain management strategies, and (4) training in pain and dementia care. Healthcare professionals and family carers reported challenges in pain identification. People with dementia also mentioned their pain being unrecognised by carers. Facilitators included familiarity and communication with people with dementia and family carers. Non-verbal cues and unusual behaviours were commonly used to identify pain, and a personalised pain assessment approach was highlighted. Non-pharmacological strategies were used as the first-line therapy to manage pain. However, a lack of knowledge and training in pain and dementia care indicated the need for a training program (e.g., a self-paced online short course). CONCLUSIONS: Pain assessment and management in people with dementia is challenging, primarily due to communication barriers and a lack of skill training. Formal pain assessment and management training and efficient, easy-to-use pain assessment tools are needed to address this. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND/OR PATIENT CARE: Limited communication capacity in people with dementia and lack of training in carers are key challenges regarding pain assessment and management in people with dementia. Improved training in communication, pain assessment, and management skills may help to address these challenges. IMPACT: This study addressed a lack of knowledge and skills for healthcare professionals and family carers in effective pain assessment and management in people with dementia. Collaborative communication among different stakeholders and skills training may overcome the challenges and barriers. REPORTING METHOD: COREQ guidelines were followed when reporting this study. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Healthcare professionals, people with dementia, and family carers contributed to the design of interview questions and data collection.

MOTIVATION: The integration of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into healthcare has immense potential due to the rapidly growing volume of clinical data. However, existing AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, face significant challenges in terms of explainability and reliability, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare. RESULTS: This paper proposes a novel LLM-aided feature engineering approach that enhances interpretability by extracting clinically relevant features from the Oxford Textbook of Medicine. By converting clinical notes into concept vector representations and employing a linear classifier, our method achieved an accuracy of 0.72, outperforming a traditional n-gram Logistic Regression baseline (0.64) and the GPT-4 baseline (0.48), while focusing on high-level clinical features. We also explore using Text Embeddings to reduce the overall time and cost of our approach by 97%.

BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a group of neurodegenerative disorders, with three distinctive phenotypes each presenting with different symptoms. The pathology of FTD is characterized by degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. The aim of this project was to investigate the prevalence and incidence of FTD in Iceland over the last few decades and gather information about demographics, clinical symptoms and diagnostic methods as well as to compare the three phenotypes with respect to clinical symptoms. Patients with FTD typically receive their diagnosis at Landspitali memory clinic in Reykjavik. METHODS: The study population consisted of individuals who had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia from the beginning of electronic medical records at Landspítali until 2022. Medical records were used for data collection and descriptive and analytical statistical methods were used for data processing and analyses. RESULTS: The frequency of FTD in Landspitali memory clinic population from the years 2008-2022 was found to be 1,7%. Over the entire period, a total of 97 individuals received the diagnosis, 50 men and 47 women. The prevalence was 45.3/100,000 inhabitants and the average incidence was 11.67/100,000/year. Mean age at onset of symptoms was 67 years. The behavioral variant of FTD was the most common phenotype, and the most common clinical feature of all three phenotypes was memory impairment. DISCUSSION: The prevalence of frontotemporal dementia in Iceland is lower than has been reported in some previous studies, incidence comparison is difficult due to difference in age distribution in different studies. Prevalence in the memory clinic population was low, reflecting the rarity of FTD. The average age at diagnosis was higher in Iceland than described in foreign studies and the frequency of memory impairment as an initial symptom was higher compared to foreign studies. Diagnostic methods have developed in recent years and the diagnostic process is more precise than in the earlier years of the study period.

INTRODUCTION: Medicare Advantage (MA) plan selection may differ between older adults with or without dementia in unexplored ways. This study aims to characterize MA plan choice among those with dementia. METHODS: We used the 2010 to 2018 waves of the Health and Retirement Study with linked Medicare enrollment data to identify MA respondents ≥ 65 years, with and without dementia. Conditional logit models examined how characteristics of MA plans affected choice. RESULTS: Among respondents overall, there were no differences between those with versus without dementia regarding how plan out-of-pocket cost, star rating, and type affected choice. Among the dual eligible group, those with versus without dementia were more likely to choose Special Needs Plans (difference in log odds: 0.804, p = 0.007). DISCUSSION: There were few differences in how MA plan characteristics affected choice among older adults with and without dementia. Older adults with dementia may make similar MA plan choices as those without.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite their limited benefits and serious adverse effects, psychotropics remain frequently prescribed for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia. Psychotropic polypharmacy, the use of two or more concomitant psychotropic medications, is therefore not recommended for people with dementia. The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of psychotropic polypharmacy in Australians living with dementia whose caregivers sought external NPS support from Dementia Support Australia (DSA; the national provider of NPS support) and the association of psychotropic polypharmacy with their demographics and NPS characteristics. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study of a subset of DSA referrals at baseline (i.e., yet to receive psychosocial intervention(s)) between 2016 and 2020 was conducted. Referrals with and without psychotropic polypharmacy were compared on the basis of demographic characteristics (e.g., sex, dementia subtype), NPS type (e.g., agitation), NPS severity and associated caregiver distress as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), using Pearson's chi-square test and Welch's t-test for categorical and continuous data, respectively. Logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between individual NPI domains and exposure to psychotropic polypharmacy. RESULTS: A total of 421 referrals (mean age 81.5 (standard deviation 8.5) years, 52.3% males, 46.8% Alzheimer's disease) were analysed. Of those, over 90% (n = 383) were prescribed at least one psychotropic, with 214 referrals (50.8%) prescribed psychotropic polypharmacy. The medication types most associated with psychotropic polypharmacy were antipsychotics (n = 162, 75.7%), opioids (n = 104, 48.6%), anxiolytics (n = 93, 43.5%), sedative/hypnotics (n = 52, 24.3%) and antidepressants (n = 47, 22.0%). No relationship between psychotropic polypharmacy and any variable tested was identified, including age, sex, dementia subtype and NPI severity. CONCLUSIONS: Psychotropic polypharmacy is highly prevalent in Australians living with dementia referred to external dementia-specific behaviour support programs, but no factors were associated with its presence in this cohort.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The dementia caregiving literature has largely ignored extended family caregivers who play a vital role in sustaining community living for older adults living with dementia. Guided by a life course perspective and grounded in a stress-coping framework, we focus attention on the caregiving experiences of nieces/nephews who have assumed the role of primary caregiver for their aunts/uncles, a topic that has received limited attention in the research literature. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Employing a mixed-methods design, we conducted interviews with 20 niece and 5 nephew primary caregivers (Mage = 55 years; R = 38-67). Interviews were analyzed following principles of the life history approach to understand how family history and dynamics shaped care responsibilities and practices; correlation analyses assessed associations with caregiver outcomes. RESULTS: Interactions in childhood provided the foundation for establishing relationships with aunts/uncles. Two-thirds of the nieces/nephews never expected to be their relative's caregiver, but rather either gradually "fell into it" or abruptly assumed the role because of "family circumstances." Caregivers relied primarily on their own family for help with care tasks; aunts'/uncles' family members and paid services provided targeted assistance. Nieces/nephews who relied on family support to assist with care experienced more caregiver burden and faced greater family strain. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The nieces/nephews embraced their caregiver roles and were committed to ensuring their aunts/uncles received the care they needed. Findings contribute new knowledge about the complexity of extended family relationships and realities of dementia care amidst the transformations occurring in family life today.

BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic medications (APMs) are frequently prescribed for persons living with dementia despite limited benefits and increased risks. This study examined patient characteristics of those prescribed APMs, indications for initiation, and survival outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study of community-dwelling patients enrolled in a comprehensive dementia care program (2012-2014) focused on 190 patients not on an APM at baseline, with survival analyses including 200 additional patients on an APM at program entry. Patients were followed for 2 years for APM initiation and until January 2024 for mortality. Baseline measures included patient and caregiver demographics, Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), Modified Caregiver Strain Index (MCSI), caregiver Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). Indications for APM initiation were abstracted from electronic health records. Logistic regression models examined associations between baseline characteristics and APM initiation. Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Among 190 patients (mean [SD] age, 81.2 [8.4] years; 60% female, and 80% Alzheimer's or dementia not otherwise specified) who were not on APMs at program enrollment, 65 (34%) initiated and 125 (66%) did not initiate an APM. NPI-Q severity (AOR 1.10, 95% CI 1.04-1.16) and NPI-Q distress (AOR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10) were associated with APM initiation. Agitation and psychotic symptoms were the most common indications, with quetiapine being the most frequently prescribed APM. Median survival was 37.8 months (IQR 19.3-63.2) for patients on an APM at baseline, 63.1 months (IQR 28.4-86.8) for patients initiating an APM, and 68.9 months (IQR 50-97.9) for patients not initiating an APM (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: APM initiation was common despite enrollment in a comprehensive dementia care program that prioritizes non-pharmacologic strategies. Survival differences underscore the need for risk-benefit discussions of APMs and goals of care discussions with caregivers.

INTRODUCTION: A palliative care approach can improve quality-of-life for people with dementia. It is the preference of many people with dementia to remain living at home until death, with the appropriate care. To develop a successful model for dementia palliative care in the community, it is essential to assimilate the perspectives and experiences of those affected. The guiding research question for this study was: What are people with dementia and family carers' views on a model for dementia palliative care?. METHODS: Focus groups (n = 3) were conducted with bereaved or current family carers (n = 11), and people with dementia (n = 2). Discussions centred around a proposed model of dementia palliative care. These were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three main themes were identified: living and dying well with dementia; reducing carer burden to fulfil the wish for home care; and lack of faith in the healthcare system. One statement which summarised the analysis was: "Dementia palliative care is a dream, but not a reality." This reflected participants' repeated "wish" for this "ideal" model of care, but simultaneous scepticism regarding its implementation, based on their prior experiences of healthcare services. CONCLUSION: All participants were welcoming of the proposed model for dementia palliative care and were generally positive about palliative care as a concept relating to dementia. There was consensus that the model would allow people to live and die well with dementia, and reducing the carer burden would fulfil the wish to remain at home. However systemic changes in the healthcare system will be needed to facilitate a truly person-centred, holistic, individualised and flexible model of care.

Background/Objectives: The known benefits of sport and exercise for people with dementia (PwD) and their caregivers mean that physical activity could be prioritized over pharmacological treatment. Research suggests that physical activity not only enhances the overall wellbeing of PwD, but also improves the relationships and wellbeing of their caregivers. The text examines the importance of physical activity for PwD and explores whether certain types of exercise, as well as modern tools like information and communication technology (ICT) and artificial intelligence (AI), are particularly suitable for this population given their different living environments, such as at home or in institutions. Methods: The study employed a qualitative design, conducting three focus groups (N = 17) in Slovenia with three distinct participant groups: informal caregivers (N = 6), physiotherapists in care homes (N = 7), and people diagnosed with dementia (N = 4). Data collection involved structured focus group discussions guided by key questions on types of exercise, challenges faced, and potential ICT and AI applications. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, means and standard deviations were used to summarize demographic data of respondents. Given the qualitative nature of the focus groups the emphasis was on thematic content analysis to identify common themes and insights supported by descriptive summaries to contextualize the findings. Results: The results suggest that regular physical activity tailored to an individual's existing lifestyle and abilities can be essential for improving the quality of life of PwD. Although ICT and AI play an important role in promoting and monitoring regular physical activity and a sense of safety, the use of ICT and AI tools are still the exception, not the rule. Key barriers include inadequate awareness of existing solutions, cognitive decline, physical limitations, safety concerns, and limited access to appropriate programs. The study highlights the unused potential of ICT and AI for overcoming these barriers and offers solutions like personalized exercise-which refers to a physical activity program that is tailored to an individual's specific needs, abilities, preferences, and goals-tracking, adaptive programs, and AI-driven virtual assistants that promote safety and encourage regular physical activity.

BACKGROUND: Dementia often goes undetected in hospital settings, where cognitive assessments are challenging due to illness severity and delirium. This study aimed to (1) evaluate the accuracy of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), based solely on knowledgeable informant reports, for detecting preexisting dementia and cognitive impairment in hospitalized patients compared to a gold-standard diagnosis, (2) and compare its performance to the 16-item Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE-16). METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed consecutive patients aged ≥ 65 admitted to inpatient units from five hospitals in Brazil. The informant-based CDR was administered to knowledgeable informants within 48 h of admission, capturing patients' cognitive status 3 months before hospitalization to avoid the influence of acute cognitive impairments. Blinded experts provided a gold standard clinical diagnosis of dementia or cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) based on a 90-min comprehensive assessment, including a standardized neuropsychology battery. Areas under the curve (AUC) examined diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Of 65 participants (mean age = 79.4 years; women = 54%), 34% had dementia and 32% had CIND. Compared to the gold standard, the informant-based CDR showed excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting dementia (AUC = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.86-0.98) and cognitive impairment (AUC = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.88-0.98), with a cutoff of ≥ 1 showing 98% specificity for dementia and a cutoff of ≥ 0.5 showing 98% sensitivity for cognitive impairment. Compared to the IQCODE-16, the informant-based CDR had similar performance in detecting dementia and a nonsignificant slight advantage in identifying cognitive impairment (AUC = 0.93 vs. 0.84, p = 0.069), reducing unrecognized cognitive impairment based on medical record documentation from 70% to 2%. CONCLUSIONS: Informant-based CDR is a valid and efficient tool for detecting dementia and cognitive impairment in hospitalized older adults, supporting early diagnosis and guiding multidisciplinary interventions in acute care. Its use in routine hospitals may help clinicians reduce undetected cognitive impairment, enhance decision making, and improve patient care.

The overlapping features of depressive symptoms and apathy hinder their differentiation in clinical practice, and hence a greater understanding of their neurosubstrates in dementia and its subtypes is necessary. Ninety-two dementia patients (Alzheimer's disease [AD, n = 52]; subcortical ischemic vascular disease [SIVD, n = 40]), and 30 cognitively normal subjects were evaluated using the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Grouped by AES/BDI scores, and hubs of depression/apathy were identified by comparing MRI metrics including fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) of resting-state functional MRI, and mean kurtosis (MK) of diffusion kurtosis imaging. Associations between the hubs with depressive and apathy symptoms were analyzed. Comparing low-AES and high-AES groups, fALFF indicated pervasive changes mainly within the default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal network (FPN). Comparing low-BDI and high-BDI groups, fALFF reflected changes within the DMN, FPN, and salience network (SAN). Contrarily, MK showed focal changes within DMN and SAN regions from the same group-wise comparisons. While fALFF was more correlated with DMN/FPN for AES than BDI and more significantly correlated with SIVD than AD, MK was more correlated with the left anterior cingulate cortex and right insula for AES than BDI, but more significantly correlated with AD than SIVD (all P < 0.01). Topologically, the fALFF hubs for AES and BDI centered at the posterior and anterior poles, respectively. These findings suggest that dual-modal MRI could reflect the distinct neuropathological basis for apathy and depressive symptoms in AD and SIVD.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether culturally adapted dementia prevention animations increased dementia prevention knowledge in ethnically diverse communities. METHODS: A before-and after survey conducted online and in-person between 1 February and 5 June 2022. Participants viewed the animation in Arabic, Hindi, Tamil, Cantonese, Mandarin, Greek, Italian, Spanish, Vietnamese or English. Dementia knowledge was measured using two subscales from the dementia risk reduction knowledge instrument (KoDeRR), measuring knowledge of dementia risk factor mitigation strategies and appraisal of dementia risk factors (misconceptions). RESULTS: Among the 318 respondents there was a significant increase in dementia knowledge in most languages after viewing the animation (ps < 05; except for English). Mean performance on knowledge of dementia risk factor mitigation strategies significantly increased after viewing the animation (p < .001), with a clinically meaningful effect (mean change = 3.63). Appraisal of dementia risk factor misconceptions significantly increased in the Spanish group (mean change = 1.29, p < .001), but significantly decreased in the English group (mean change = -1.09, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Viewing the animation in a language other than English was associated with an increase in KoDeRR scores for both the recognition of mitigation strategies and identification of misconceptions subscales. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Codesigned, culturally adapted in-language dementia prevention animations improve dementia prevention awareness in ethnically diverse communities.

BACKGROUND: Dementia has physical, psychological, social and economic impacts, not only for people living with dementia, but also for their carers, families and wider society. Due to the growing number of people living with dementia, children are increasingly likely to encounter family members living with dementia. The aim of this project was to pilot an educational game which was co-designed with children and people living with dementia with the intention of improving children's understanding and perception of dementia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: An acceptability study of the Kids Dementia Game was conducted in three classes in three schools in Northern Ireland. This study investigated acceptability of the game and the feasibility of online data collection using a pre-post test methodology to explore how best to collect evaluation data if the game was to be delivered on a larger scale. RESULTS: Evaluation of the game with children showed a positive level of acceptability of the game. Children found the game engaging, easy to navigate and fun to play. Feasibility of the data collection method was found to be a barrier to the pre-post test evaluation of the game. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings suggest that the game shows evidence of promise for improving public perception and understanding of dementia using an early intervention approach with children.

. Social stigma in dementia: Italian validation of the Dementia Public Stigma Scale (DEPSS). INTRODUCTION: Dementia-related stigma is a significant barrier to supporting people with dementia and promoting their social inclusion. The Dementia Public Stigma Scale (DePSS) measures all the dimensions of dementia-related public stigma: fear and discomfort, inability and loss, personality recognition, burden and exclusion. AIM: To validate the DePSS in Italian and measure dementia-related public stigma. METHOD: The DePSS has 16 items rated on a Likert scale 1-7 (1=strongly disagree; 7=strongly agree). The average score for the overall scale and for each of its five factors ranges from 1 to 7, higher scores indicate higher stigma. The original English tool was translated and culturally adapted and psychometric validation was performed. The scale was then tested on 1,329 people (aged 14-93 years). RESULTS: The Italian version of the DePSS confirmed the original five-factor structure and was a clear, valid and reliable tool for measuring dementia-related stigma. The median overall score was 3.6 (IQR 3.1-4.0) that indicates moderate stigma. The highest levels of stigma emerged in the factor inability and loss (median 4.8, IQR 4.2-5.4) and burden (median 4.0, IQR 2.5-5.0). Living with a person with dementia was not apparently associated with the overall stigma level (p=0.406) nor with any of its dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: The Italian DePSS version will be able to shape healthcare strategies and educational and awareness initiatives.

A growing number of Australians live with, or are at risk for, dementia. A diagnosis is a common prompt for people to seek legal advice to plan for their future. It is important that lawyers are equipped with up-to-date knowledge and resources to work effectively with clients in these circumstances. This article reports on a research project that involved the delivery of dementia-focused online training for lawyers and the piloting of an evaluation strategy. Legal practitioners in two Australian states were recruited for this pilot study. Wills/estates and elder law were common areas of practice. Data were collected through in-course activities (eg polls, discussion posts) and surveys administered at course completion and at four-month follow-up. The findings were positive both in terms of the suitability of the training and the feasibility of the evaluation model. This study also contributes insights into the role of the legal profession and lawyering practices in advancing the objectives of Australia's National Dementia Action Plan.

This paper addresses the question 'is there truth in fiction?', by synthesising a range of disciplinary approaches to the issue, as well as drawing on empirical research carried out with readers of fiction about dementia (hereafter, dementia fiction). We argue that fiction-perhaps because of its fictional status and apparatus-invites readers to consider its truth value, to explore the possibilities of human experience and interrogate issues relative to their subjective experience, community or society. The findings have significant implications for the Medical Humanities' use of fictional texts to explore lived medical conditions and experiences, as well as claims made about the potential for fiction to affect real-world understandings, awareness and empathy around the conditions depicted. We show that the techniques used in fictional language may be artifice, but they simulate a truth that corresponds with reality.

BACKGROUND: Over the last decade there has been a recognition of the need for better dementia education for undergraduate healthcare professionals. Time for Dementia is an innovative educational programme in the UK whereby students learn about the condition directly from a two-year longitudinal contact with a person living with dementia and their families. There is evidence that such programmes have positive outcomes for students in terms of improved attitudes and knowledge, however, students' evaluations of these programmes are scarce. OBJECTIVES: To understand the satisfaction of the students taking part in Time for Dementia and their perceptions of the programme. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey, with Likert responses, was completed to assess overall levels of satisfaction for students enrolled in Time for Dementia. 1,225 students consented and completed the satisfaction survey at five universities in England. Factors that might predict satisfaction were explored using multiple regression analysis. A qualitative framework thematic analysis explored the best aspects of the programme and possible improvements, as recorded by student responses to open text questions. RESULTS: 78% of students agreed or strongly agreed that Time for Dementia had increased their knowledge of psychosocial issues, and 69% enjoyed the programme. The multiple regression analysis found satisfaction was statistically significantly higher for students who completed more visits; took part after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; were of Black or Asian ethnicities (compared to White British/European); and were relatively older. The themes related to the best aspects of the programme were that Time for Dementia provides relational learning, understanding the impact of dementia on family and thinking psychosocially. Improvements include preferred programme structure, the need for clarity of expectations and addressing barriers to learning. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the value of Time for Dementia as assessed by students. Key considerations to ensure satisfaction include the fidelity of programme experience and clear expectations.

People living with dementia require care from a variety of health professionals and in different settings to optimize their quality of life. A phase-based approach to costing health system use supports our understanding of the longitudinal costs of care through disease progression at a population level. This report estimates five-year and phase-based net health system costs of dementia.

People with dementia have complex medical, functional, and social needs and experience highly variable care quality and outcomes across the U.S. health care system. Community-based physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants serve critical roles in diagnosing and managing dementia, yet little is known about this workforce and factors contributing to variability in care. The National Dementia Workforce Study (NDWS), sponsored by the National Institute on Aging, is conducting large nationally representative surveys of health care workers who provide care to people with dementia in nursing homes, assisted living communities, home care, and community medical practices. In this report, we summarize the methods for one of those surveys, the NDWS Community Clinician Survey, which surveys community-based physicians and advanced practice providers specializing in primary care, psychiatry, and neurology who provide clinical care to people with dementia. This survey captures comprehensive data on these clinicians, including demographics, training, and licensure; where and how they practice; their patient panels; processes of care for dementia diagnosis and management; and job factors influencing retention and turnover. These survey data can be linked with Medicare claims and other administrative data sources to allow for expansive research on this workforce and the care they provide. In turn, this will generate insights into modifiable factors that can be targeted to prepare, expand, and strengthen the clinical workforce to optimize care and meet demand for the growing population of people with dementia.

Using a theoretical framework that underscores the social dimension of meaning-making processes, this study delved into the social representations of dementia in the Italian context and the personal meanings expressed by three distinct groups of participants. The study involved ninety-two episodic interviews with people living with dementia and those who had provided care as professionals or informal caregivers. The collected data underwent various types of analysis. A hierarchical descending analysis was initially conducted using IRaMuTeQ to elucidate the lexical worlds that form the shared idea of dementia. This was followed by a more interpretative thematic analysis using Atlas.ti. The results reveal the diverse perspectives of the groups in articulating the contents of social representations, which can guide actions in the care and management of the disease.

BACKGROUND: Psychometrically sound resilience outcome measures are essential to establish how health and care services or interventions can enhance the resilience of people living with dementia. In response to a lack of resilience outcome measures designed specifically with, and for, people living with dementia, this research builds on several stages of measurement development and evaluates the psychometric properties of a new outcome measure of resilience for people living with dementia. METHODS: We aimed to recruit 185 people aged 18 + living with dementia. An online survey containing demographic questions, the draft 37-item resilience measure, the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD- 7) and the 5-item Canterbury Wellbeing Scale was widely shared in the UK. Three people living with dementia piloted the survey before recruitment commenced and gave suggestions for improvement. Exploratory factor analysis was applied to the draft resilience measure and the construct validity and internal consistency ascertained. Convergent validity with other measures was tested. RESULTS: Minor changes were made to the survey following piloting to help people with dementia. The survey was completed by 193 participants, aged 47-93 (M = 69.9; SD = 9.5), 58% male, and living with a range of dementia diagnoses. The exploratory factor analysis led to a final 19-item measure (Chronbach's Alpha = 0.85) with 5-factors underlying resilience: 'Outlook', 'Adaptation', 'Acceptance', 'community and peer support' and 'family and friends'. The new resilience measure demonstrated convergent validity with well-being (r = 0.49, p < 0.001) and anxiety (r = - 0.28, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study presents preliminary field-testing and validation of the Bangor Dementia Resilience Scale, a new psychometrically sound resilience measure for people living with mild to moderate dementia. The scale may be a valuable tool for practitioners to provide strengths-based and person-centred support to maintain and enhance the resilience of people living with dementia, and evaluating the extent to which health and social care services may improve resilience. Given the global policy focus to support people with dementia to live as well as possible, the new scale has international significance for translation and cultural adaptation by other countries.

BackgroundA collaborative, multi-disciplinary team input is crucial for the optimal management of the older adult with complex care needs such as dementia. Interprofessional learning (IPL) at undergraduate level can lead to improved collaborative knowledge and skills. The aim of this study was to develop, deliver and evaluate an IPL dementia workshop for healthcare students across 11 disciplines. A secondary aim was to determine whether there is a clinical application of learned knowledge in students who completed the workshop and subsequently underwent clinical placement.MethodsThe design of the IPL workshop aligned with Kern's map for the development of a curriculum in medical education. The Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS) was used to assess students' knowledge of dementia pre-and-post workshop, as well as opened-ended questions on role recognition and communication.ResultsA total of 102 students completed the workshop questionnaire, with a follow up of 47 students on clinical placement. There was a statistically significant increase in students' knowledge and confidence levels in communication with a person with dementia. Students reported positively on the workshop format, the collaborative nature of the workshop, as well as the role of the patient advocate. The follow up of students on clinical placement showed a perceived behavioural change in communication modification.ConclusionOur study demonstrates the benefits of an IPL initiative across multiple disciplines, with perceived behavioural change on clinical placement.

INTRODUCTION: Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant agent widely used in organ transplantation. Neurotoxicity due to tacrolimus is frequently reported in the literature with varied presentations from tremors to leukoencephalopathy. Drugs used to prevent graft rejection can cause significant morbidity. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old male developed rapidly progressive dementia shortly after liver transplantation. Imaging revealed abnormal signal intensities, symmetrically involving bilateral caudate head and putamen with diffusion restriction mimicking CJD. Blood levels of tacrolimus were repeatedly normal. He improved completely over 4-6 weeks after stopping tacrolimus. DISCUSSION: Tacrolimus is used on a daily basis in most post-transplantation patients. Neurotoxicity related to the medications must be kept in the differential list while investigating rapidly progressing dementia. This case highlights the importance of suspecting tacrolimus toxicity even with therapeutic drug levels.

Recent policy shifts in the United States have created opportunities for managed care organizations (MCOs) to put in place care navigators, like Dementia Care Specialists (DCS), to coordinate care for older adults living with dementia and their families. This paper presents findings of the DCS training model developed primarily for nurse and social work care managers within ten MCOs that participated in California's pilot program serving Medicare-Medicaid dual-eligible members as part of a contracted collaboration with state agencies and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services between 2013 and 2018, along with updated training model resources for replication.

BACKGROUND: Abuse of older people is common and people living with dementia are at high risk of being subjected to abuse. This study protocol describes the development and procedure to test the validity of two new screening instruments to detect abuse of people with dementia: 1) The REAGERA-S20, intended to be answered by people with dementia themselves, including questions about their abusive experiences, and 2) The REAGERA - N, intended to be answered by the next of kin of people with dementia, including questions about their own exposure to abuse, their own perpetration as well as the witnessing of abusive acts. In addition, the Risk on Elder Abuse and Mistreatment Instrument (REAMI) is translated into Swedish within the project and will be validated. Finally, qualitative interviews are conducted to explore the experiences of abuse from the perspective of both the person with dementia and the next of kin. METHOD: People with mild to moderate dementia (n = 80) and their next of kin (n = 80) are recruited at health and social care facilities providing care to people with dementia. In cases of severe dementia, only next of kin is included. At the time of data collection, participants fill out the instruments and are thereafter interviewed, first separately and then jointly by researchers about their abusive experiences. The interviews are used as a gold standard for calculating the properties of the instruments, e.g., sensitivity and specificity, but will also be used for qualitative analysis concerning the experiences of abuse. Health and social care professionals that are well acquainted with the participants fill out the REAMI and results will be validated using the results of the interviews as the gold standard. DISCUSSION: This study protocol describes a research project that aims towards a comprehensive identification and understanding of abuse of people with dementia by including the perspective of both people with dementia themselves, their next of kin and professionals. If the instruments are found to be reliable they can be used to detect abuse in people with dementia. Also, the qualitative interviews with participants will enhance our understanding of abuse of people with dementia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06659822.

BACKGROUND: A Walk Through Dementia (AWTD) is a learning resource that shows dementia from the perspective of people with the condition. Its three 360-degree simulation films depict a person with dementia in different everyday situations and can be viewed online or on a smartphone using an app. AIM: To evaluate how first-year undergraduate healthcare students react to the AWTD app, what they learn from it and the influence it has on their clinical practice during placements. METHOD: The app was used as a learning tool during two dementia training days attended by 414 students at Bournemouth University. Data were collected on the day via a post-training survey and four months later via two focus groups with a small purposive sample of students. FINDINGS: The survey was completed by 271 of the 414 students (65% response rate) and 11 students participated in the focus groups. Survey respondents found the app easy to use and engaging. They reported a deeper understanding of dementia and felt that the app had changed their attitude towards people with dementia. Focus group participants discussed how they approached people with dementia with more awareness, more confidence and in a more person-centred manner. CONCLUSION: There are potential benefits of using the AWTD app in dementia education for undergraduate healthcare students, but further research is needed to confirm its effectiveness as a learning tool.

BACKGROUND: Dementia prevalence in low- and middle-income countries is increasing, yet epidemiological data from African populations remain scarce. Crucial risk factors differ in Africa from more intensively studied global areas, including a higher burden of cerebrovascular disease and HIV, but lower rates of other risk factors like physical inactivity.Understanding dementia aetiology in African settings has been limited by the expensive and invasive nature of biomarker testing. This study leverages developments in blood-based and retinal imaging biomarker technology to examine the drivers of dementia in older Ugandans.People with dementia have complex needs benefiting from multi-dimensional support. Understanding current services will allow identification of barriers and opportunities to strengthen support available to people with dementia and their families. METHODS: The study is nested within the General Population Cohort run by the Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute & London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Research Unit. All adults aged 60+ (around 1400) are undergoing brief cognitive screening.In Part 1, cohort participants are selected based on screening scores to undergo detailed cognitive assessment, using methods developed by the 10/66 Dementia Research Group. Part 2 is a case control study of people with and without dementia using antecedent data, questionnaires, physical assessment, retinal imaging, and Alzheimer's blood-based biomarkers. We will also compare disability, frailty, quality of life, and social engagement in people with and without dementia.Part 3 assesses current formal support structures for people with dementia through review of publicly available literature and expert interviews. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in Africa using blood-based and retinal imaging biomarkers to examine pathological processes underlying dementia, and systematically map services available for people with dementia. This paves the way for effective policy strategies and further focused research regarding both dementia prevention and support for affected people and their families.

A 75-year-old Chinese American man presented to behavioral neurology clinic for a second opinion of dementia with Lewy body disease (DLB). The clinical manifestations met the criteria for a probable DLB diagnosis. Yet, in-depth evaluation unveiled clinical history, family history, and neuroimaging evidences that suggested a diagnosis of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (FTD). A heterozygous pathogenic variant in the microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAPT) was identified through genetic testing and confirmed the diagnosis of autosomal dominant MAPT-related FTD. This case is the first reported instance of MAPT-related FTD presenting with well-formed visual hallucinations in an elderly Chinese American.

This article synthesizes findings, from the Autism/Dementia Work Group of the 2nd International Summit on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia, on the nature of autism/autism spectrum disorder and later-age neuropathologies, particularly dementia. The convened group of experts explored genetic, neurobiological, and environmental risk factors that may affect the lifespan and lived experiences of older adults with autism. A review of current literature indicates a lack of comprehensive information on the demographics and factors associated with aging in autistic adults. However, our understanding of autism is evolving, challenging traditional views of it as a static, inherited neurodevelopmental disorder. The relationship between autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions-such as Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex-reflects the complex genetic landscape of neurodevelopmental disorders. These genetic and familial factors may contribute to progressive health challenges and cognitive decline in later life. Key findings reveal a complex link between autism and dementia, despite limited research on this relationship, particularly among older adults. The overall prevalence of dementia in this population appears to be influenced by co-occurring intellectual disabilities, particularly Down syndrome. While the association between autism and specific types of dementia is still not well understood, the reviewed evidence suggests a notable connection with frontotemporal dementia, although causality has not been established. Exploration of biomarkers may offer further insights. Currently, the relationship between autism, cognitive health, and cognitive decline in older adults remains a complex and underexplored area of research.

The need for person- and relationship-centered care (PCC/RCC) in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is well established. Recognizing the limitations of PCC in fully honoring the intricate interdependencies between care partners and persons living with dementia, a new training program called Bravo Zulu was developed. This comprehensive, 12-hour dementia training program aims to enhance personhood beliefs and self-efficacy among care partners, improving the experience of care and support for both people living with dementia and their care partners. Responses from 182 participants who completed the training were analyzed using paired t-tests to assess changes in personhood beliefs and self-efficacy. The Bravo Zulu training produced significant increases in both personhood beliefs and self-efficacy. Notably, healthcare professionals without prior care partner training exhibited the greatest gains in personhood beliefs, while participants who were not direct care partners showed substantial improvements in self-efficacy. Overall, these findings support the concept of tailoring dementia education to ensure care partners and healthcare professionals are able to provide culturally competent care that is aligned with the diverse backgrounds of people living with dementia. Expanding access to high-quality interactive programs such as Bravo Zulu can contribute to strengthening the dementia care workforce and improving care experiences for all involved.

To explore the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) on dementia and cognitive impairment among medical specialists with expertise unrelated to dementia. This study enrolled medical specialists with expertise unrelated to dementia from 318 medical institutions in China, between March and April 2023. A self-designed questionnaire was used for data collection and KAP assessment. A total of 1288 valid questionnaires were collected, 62.58% from female participants. The KAP scores were 11.02 ± 2.11 (range: 0-13), 22.16 ± 3.40 (range: 0-24), and 29.48 ± 6.92 (range: 0-32), respectively. The structural equation model showed that knowledge was positively associated with attitude (path coefficient = 0.503, P < 0.001), while both knowledge (path coefficient = 0.713, P < 0.001) and attitude (path coefficient = 0.797, P < 0.001) were positively associated with practice. Type of institution (path coefficient = 0.184, P = 0.035) and professional title (path coefficient = 0.133, P = 0.026) were positively associated with knowledge score. The mediation analysis revealed the significant total effects for professional title on knowledge, knowledge and professional title on attitude, and knowledge, attitude, and education on practice. Medical specialists in China with expertise unrelated to dementia might have good knowledge, a positive attitude, and proactive practice toward dementia and cognitive impairment. Tailored educational interventions should be specifically designed for individuals with lower professional titles and those working outside public tertiary hospitals.

OBJECTIVE: There are significant difficulties associated with the management of dementia patients in hospitals, leading to adverse patient outcomes, prolonged length of stay (LOS), strain on resources and high readmission rates. This study aimed to investigate these factors in the context of a regional hospital. DESIGN: This study retrospectively reviewed all dementia admissions in a publicly funded Australian regional hospital from January 2022 to December 2022. METHODS: All admissions including an ICD-10 coded dementia diagnosis were assessed, and data extracted using the integrated electronic medical record. SETTING: Overall, 257 bed Australian regional hospital in an area with a Modified Monash Model rating of 2. PARTICIPANTS: There were 105 dementia patients admitted within the study period. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Dementia severity, LOS, consultation liaison (CL) psychiatry involvement, readmission rates, and discharge destinations. RESULTS: The LOS in patients with dementia was 23.3 (± 35.2) days compared to age-matched patients without dementia admitted in the same period with a LOS of 8.2 (± 4.7) days. Dementia patients who died in hospital had the longest acute LOS at 14.4 (± 8.8) days. Dementia patients who were admitted from their usual residential aged care facility had the longest maintenance LOS at 69 (± 83.3) days. CONCLUSIONS: This research contributes information to the current knowledge gap of dementia care in regional hospitals. Data from this study may help to inform the development of strategies for effective hospital-based dementia care and interventions.

OBJECTIVE: Dementia represents a growing public health challenge, affecting an increasing number of individuals. It encompasses a broad spectrum of cognitive impairments, ranging from mild to severe stages, each of which demands varying levels of care. Current diagnostic approaches often treat dementia as a uniform condition, potentially overlooking clinically significant subtypes, which limits the effectiveness of treatment and care strategies. This study seeks to address the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods by applying unsupervised machine learning techniques to a large, multi-modal dataset of dementia patients (encompassing multiple data sources including clinical, demographic, gene expression and protein concentrations), with the aim of identifying distinct subtypes within the population. The primary focus is on differentiating between mild and severe stages of dementia to improve diagnostic accuracy and personalize treatment plans. METHODS: The dataset analyzed included 911 individuals, described by 157 multi-modal characteristics, encompassing clinical, genomic, proteomic and sociodemographic features. After handling missing data, the dataset was reduced to 561 rows and 135 columns. Various dimensionality reduction techniques were applied to improve the feature-to-patient ratio, and unsupervised clustering methods were employed to identify potential subtypes. The major novelty in our methodology regards the combination of different techniques, bridging high-dimensional statistical inference, multi-modal dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis, to appropriately model the multi-modal nature of the data and ensure clinical relevance. RESULTS: The analysis revealed distinct clusters within the dementia population, each characterized by specific clinical and demographic profiles. These profiles included variations in biomarkers, cognitive scores, and disability levels. The findings suggest the presence of previously unrecognized subgroups, distinguished by their genomic, proteomic, and clinical characteristics. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that unsupervised machine learning can effectively identify clinically relevant subtypes of dementia, with important implications for diagnosis and personalized treatment. Further research is required to validate these findings and investigate their potential to improve patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: This mixed-method study aimed to develop and validate an activity reminder clock for dementia through user testing and feedback. The increasing prevalence of dementia worldwide presents significant challenges for both patients and caregivers. Dementia impairs cognitive functions, complicating daily routines and management of everyday tasks. As the disease progresses, patients often struggle with time management and maintaining a structured routine, which can lead to increased confusion and reduced quality of life. Assistive technologies, such as activity reminder clocks, have emerged as potential solutions to help address these challenges. These devices are designed to aid individuals with dementia by providing reminders for daily activities, which can help them maintain a sense of normalcy and independence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was done in three main stages: the qualitative phase (phase 1), the device development phase (phase 2), and the quantitative phase (phase 3). The study's two sections consist of demographic and semi-structured interview questions. The semi-structured survey instrument was created for Interviews with medical professionals and caregivers and included expectations for this kind of technology, as well as opinions on the necessity of an activity reminder clock and the difficulties involved in caring for dementia patients. During the qualitative phase, interviews with physicians and caregivers revealed themes such as the advantages of assistive technology and difficulties with implementation. Thematic analysis influenced the development of the user-friendly activity reminder clock. In the subsequent quantitative study, which had thirty participants, a Likert scale was used to assess effectiveness. RESULTS: The results revealed a resounding yes (86.67%), with 93.33% of participants thinking the reminder clock was essential for dementia care. A whopping 93% of the participants expressed satisfaction with its usability, affordability, and convenience of use. Fisher's exact tests revealed a significant correlation between age and recommending the device to others (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The study highlights the reminder clock's effectiveness and utility in enhancing daily tasks. Everyone agrees that it is necessary, logical, and beneficial. The findings indicate that age affects suggestions for device adoption and Favors tailored technology interventions to improve the quality of life for dementia patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Montessori-based interventions (MBIs) promote quality of life among older adults living with dementia. We used dementia care mapping (DCM) to evaluate the impact of a small-scale MBI. DCM is a systematic observation tool that records the behavior and mood/engagement of individuals living with dementia and can be used to improve quality of care and well-being. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Pre- and post-intervention data from 15 care community residents compared (1) residents' range and types of behaviors, (2) their mood/engagement, and (3) staff behaviors that facilitated and impeded residents' personhood. In this mixed-methods study, deductive qualitative content analysis of DCM field notes further explored staff behaviors. RESULTS: Post-intervention, a significantly higher proportion of residents' behaviors had the potential to promote their well-being, although there was little change in mood/engagement while engaging in those behaviors. Post-intervention, there was also a significant increase in staff behaviors that facilitated, and a decrease in staff behaviors that impeded, residents' personhood. Furthermore, post-intervention, staff interactions with residents were more open-ended and inclusive. Although some staff behaviors still excluded residents, the exclusion was more benign than pre-intervention. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: DCM documented incremental changes toward person-centered care, and DCM field notes provided insight into missed opportunities for effective staff interactions with residents. Taken together, findings provide additional support for the use of MBIs and highlight the usefulness of DCM, especially its associated field notes, to help researchers and practitioners create environments that promote the personhood that individuals living with dementia deserve.

Background: People from South Asian communities are under-represented at all levels of dementia services. Consequently, there is pressure for the statutory sector to deliver services in partnership with Voluntary, Community, Faith and Social Enterprises (VCFSEs). This study set out to explore the constraints to effective partnership working which prevent dementia care from being delivered in an equitable way.Methods: Data collection consisted of two phases. First, we interviewed seven people with experience of partnership working and developed three fictional vignettes that were representative of the challenges they faced. We then used these vignettes to stimulate discussion in focus groups and interviews with 13 VCFSE and 16 statutory sector participants. Data was analysed using deductive thematic analysis.Findings: Three themes were developed during the analysis. First, White British-centric services focused on the challenges for statutory services in meeting the needs of South Asians, developing flexible, responsive services and making inclusive partnership working truly meaningful. Second, VCFSE participants (but not statutory service participants) associated a failure to deliver effective partnership working with unconscious bias operating within systems, leading to the devaluing of their expertise and to their views being ignored. Finally, participants emphasised the need to prioritise relationships if they were to meet the challenges of developing partnership working.Conclusion: We identified three constraints acting to prevent effective partnership working. First, the different meanings that statutory and VCFSE participants attach to challenges threatens their ability to develop a shared understanding of the needs of communities. Second, a reluctance to explicitly address service deficiencies can mean that stereotypes remain unaddressed. Finally, while both parties lacked power to change the fundamentals of service delivery, power and resources were also unbalanced with VCSFE services being more reliant on the statutory sector.

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is frequently comorbid with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and brain endothelial cells (BECs) express genes associated with AD genetic risk. However, the epigenome of neurovascular cells and its intersection with genetic risk remain unexplored. Here, we generated gene regulomes for human BECs, mural cells, and other brain cell types and showed that AD heritability is primarily immune related, with a modest BEC enrichment. On the other hand, SVD heritability is enriched across the neurovascular unit, including astrocytes. Enhancer-to-gene interactomes implicated disease-distinct putative risk genes associated with amyloid and phospholipid processes in AD and senescence-associated pathways in SVD. Motifs for putative partners of lineage-determining transcription factors (TFs) in microglia and BECs were enriched for AD and SVD variants linked to disease-associated genes. In silico screening of compounds implicated vitamin D receptor agonists, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), histone deacetylase (HDAC), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors for AD. Our findings highlight regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic targets within the neurovascular system.

INTRODUCTION: Plasma biomarkers offer promise for improving the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and differentiating AD and other neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) like frontotemporal dementia (FTD) from primary psychiatric disorders (PPDs), particularly in younger patients. METHODS: In this prospective study, we investigated plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in 341 unselected participants from a neuropsychiatry memory clinic, including AD (n = 40), behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) (n = 15), PPD (n = 69), other NDs, and controls. RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217 showed strong diagnostic performance for distinguishing AD from bvFTD (96% accuracy) and PPD (93% accuracy). NfL best distinguished all NDs from PPD, while GFAP did not bring additional value. Biomarker profiles using predefined cut-offs and age-adjusted z-scores further clarified group differences. DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 and NfL have strong diagnostic utility in real-world, diagnostically complex cohorts. These findings support implementation of scalable blood-based biomarkers to improve early and accurate diagnosis in memory clinical settings. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma p-tau217 was significantly elevated in AD compared to other disorders. P-tau217 distinguished AD from bvFTD with high accuracy. P-tau217 distinguished AD from PPDs with high accuracy. NfL/p-tau217 ratio and GFAP added limited diagnostic value compared to p-tau217 and NfL. Findings support blood biomarkers in younger, real-world clinical cohorts.

Revealing the temporal evolution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers during aging is critical to understanding disease pathogenesis and developing early diagnoses and interventions for Alzheimer's disease (AD). CSF was obtained from 549 cognitively normal subjects between 18 and 93 years of age. 12 AD-related biomarkers were evaluated, including amyloid β (Aβ42, Aβ40, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio), hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau), neuronal injury/degeneration (T-tau, NFL, NSE, H-FABP, VILIP-1), neuroinflammation biomarkers (YKL-40, TREM2), and α-synuclein (α-synuclein). Associations between these biomarkers and age as well as apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status were evaluated, and the associations among biomarkers were assessed. CSF Aβ42, P-tau, and T-tau levels exhibited nonlinear associations with age, among which Aβ42 was significantly modulated by APOE ε4 status. Specifically, an accelerated decline in Aβ42 levels occurred at 45.69 years of age in the APOE ε4+ group, which was almost 23 years earlier than that in the APOE ε4- group (68.02 years). The age-related change pattern of CSF P-tau is similar to that of T-tau, with both increasing slightly with age but showing an accelerated change at ≈60 years of age in the APOE ε4+ group. All the other biomarkers except for α-synuclein were linearly associated with age, and APOE ε4 status had no effect on these associations. Most biomarkers were positively correlated with each other except for Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. The evolution of AD-related biomarkers in CSF varies throughout the adult lifespan, with the APOE ε4 allele modifying the temporal changes in CSF Aβ42 levels, as well as potentially influencing P-tau and T-tau levels.

BACKGROUND: There is a lack of analysis and prediction of the disease burden of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADOD) in Asia. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore the impact of ADOD on the Asian region during the period from 1990 to 2021. DESIGN: Data on ADOD in Asia from 1990 to 2021 were collected from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2021. We analyzed the number and age-standardized rates (ASRs) of incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of ADOD from 1990 to 2021. Joinpoint regression analysis was performed, and the average annual percent changes (AAPCs) were calculated to evaluate the trends during this period. Subsequently, an auto - regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) prediction model analysis was conducted to assess the trends in the next 30 years, aiming to report the epidemiology and disease burden of ADOD in Asia. RESULTS: According to the analysis of the GBD database in 2021, the deaths, DALYs, incidence, and prevalence of ADOD increased by 297.34 %, 249.54 %, 244.73 %, and 250.44 % in Asia from 1990 to 2021. The ASRs of incidence, prevalence, death, and DALYs in both males and females, which consistently increased over the study period, showed that the ASRs of all females were consistently higher than those of males in Asia from 1990 to 2021. During the period from 1990 to 2021, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates witnessed the greatest changes in the number of DALYs, incidence, and prevalence. Afghanistan and China had the highest age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) in 2021. It is worth noting that high fasting blood glucose is the top risk factor for the onset of ADOD. Females are more susceptible to the risk factor of high body-mass index (BMI), while males are more likely to be affected by smoking. According to the analysis of the ARIMA prediction model, the disease burden of ADOD in Asia will continue to show an upward trend in the next 30 years. CONCLUSIONS: We should pay attention to the issue of population aging, attach importance to the intervention measures targeting the risk factors of ADOD, and formulate action plans to address the rising incidence of ADOD.

BACKGROUND: Delivering a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) can be challenging not just for patients and families, but also for clinicians. Our objective was to understand dementia specialty care clinicians' perspectives on their role in diagnosis and diagnostic disclosure in dementia. METHODS: Qualitative interviews with clinicians from a specialty tertiary dementia care center focused on practices, challenges, and opportunities addressing patient and caregiver needs in dementia. Data was analyzed by an interdisciplinary team using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The 16 participants included behavioral neurologists, social workers, neuropsychologists, and nurses. Themes included the value of providing an accurate diagnosis, the timing and challenges of delivering a diagnosis, the central focus on diagnosis alongside the need for more education on care management, and the role of the interdisciplinary team. DISCUSSION: We identified areas for improvement and strengths that can be built upon or adapted to other settings, including providing clinicians in specialty and primary care settings more guidance and support when diagnostic challenges arise, strengthening interdisciplinary teamwork, and making dementia diagnosis and care more accessible.

In the context of the escalating global health challenge posed by Alzheimer's disease (AD), this comprehensive review considers the potential of melatonin in both preventive and therapeutic capacities. As a naturally occurring hormone and robust antioxidant, accumulating evidence suggests melatonin is a compelling candidate to consider in the context of AD-related pathologies. The review considers several mechanisms, including potential effects on amyloid-beta and pathologic tau burden, antioxidant defense, immune modulation, and regulation of circadian rhythms. Despite its promise, several gaps need to be addressed prior to clinical translation. These include conducting additional randomized clinical trials in patients with or at risk for AD dementia, determining optimal dosage and timing, and further determining potential side effects, particularly of long-term use. This review consolidates existing knowledge, identifies gaps, and suggests directions for future research to better understand the potential of melatonin for neuroprotection and disease mitigation within the landscape of AD.

The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems version 11 (ICD-11) represents a conceptual advance over ICD-10 in the classification of dementias. Although the syndromic classification in the chapter "Neurocognitive disorders" remains in principle unchanged, the introduction of severity levels and the central positioning of mental and behavioral symptoms enables a more precise coding of the clinical diagnoses. Furthermore, the introduction of mild neurocognitive disorder as a prodromal state of dementia is new. The clinical criteria developed by international experts, e.g., for frontotemporal dementia or Lewy body disease, are not yet sufficiently included in ICD-11. Biomarkers for the etiological diagnostics of dementia are also not mentioned, so that it is unclear which role they play in the disease classification in ICD-11. Due to the rapid development in the field of neurodegenerative diseases, regular updates would be desirable.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by inter-individual heterogeneity in brain degeneration, limiting diagnostic and prognostic precision. We present a novel framework integrating Morphometric Inverse Divergence (MIND) networks with hierarchical Bayesian large-scale population modelling to identify individual-level neuroanatomical deviations. METHODS: MIND networks quantify similarity between brain regions using multivariate MRI features. A normative model of regional MIND values trained on UK Biobank (N=35,133) was applied to the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center cohort (N=3,567). We examined brain deviations across clinical stages, APOE genotypes, mortality risk, and neuropathological burden. RESULTS: Negative deviations (reduced MIND) stratified disease stages (p<0.01) and showed functional network enrichment in AD. Greater negative deviations characterised APOE ε4 homozygotes and correlated with postmortem neuropathological severity (p=0.032). Neurobiological decoding revealed associations with neurotransmitter receptor distributions and cortical organisation properties. DISCUSSION: This population neuroimaging modelling enables individualised brain mapping with direct utility for diagnosis, prognosis, and understanding of biological mechanisms.

IMPORTANCE: Prior studies of dementia incidence in the US often focused on narrow regions, leaving regional variation unclear and potential explanatory factors unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate geographic differences in dementia incidence across the US among older adults enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: Cohort study spanning October 1999 to September 2021 with a mean follow-up time of 12.6 years. Data were analyzed from October 2023 to September 2024 among a random sample of 1 268 599 dementia-free veterans aged 65 years or older with available zip code information in locations across the US. We excluded 22 512 with missing zip codes, 265 850 with no follow-up, and 37 370 with prevalent dementia. EXPOSURE: Geographical region categories across the US were defined using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion definition, which divides the US into 10 regions, each composed of 4 to 7 states. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Dementia diagnoses were based on International Classification of Diseases codes and calculated for zip codes within the CDC regions. Poisson regression models were used to calculate dementia incidence per 1000 person-years and assess regional differences in incidence rate ratios with several covariate models. RESULTS: Among the 1 268 599 participants (mean age, 73.9 [SD, 6.1] years; n = 25 335 [2%] female), dementia incidence rates per 1000 person-years were lowest in the Mid-Atlantic (11.2; 95% CI, 11.1-11.4) and highest in the Southeast (14.0; 95% CI, 13.8-14.2). Compared with the Mid-Atlantic, the regions with the greatest demographically adjusted incidence included the Southeast (rate ratio [RR], 1.25; 95% CI, 1.22-1.28), Northwest (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.20-1.27), Rocky Mountains (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.20-1.26), South (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.15-1.20), Midwest (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.14), and South Atlantic (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.10-1.14); the remaining regions had similar (<10% difference) incidence. Additional adjustments for rurality and cardiovascular comorbidities and accounting for the competing risk of death produced similar results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among older adults in the VHA, dementia incidence varied significantly across US regions, independent of key covariates. These findings highlight the need for targeted health care planning, public health interventions, and policy development.

Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), affects millions worldwide, leading to cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioral disturbances. Agitation, a common symptom, poses significant challenges for patients and caregivers. This systematic review evaluates pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for managing agitation in dementia. Nine clinical studies were analyzed, encompassing medications like brexpiprazole and non-pharmacological approaches such as music therapy and digital care programs. Pharmacological treatments showed mixed efficacy and safety profiles, with brexpiprazole demonstrating dose-dependent benefits and mirtazapine associating with higher mortality rates. Non-pharmacological interventions exhibited promising results in reducing agitation without adverse effects. The review underscores the importance of personalized care strategies tailored to individual patient needs and preferences to enhance treatment efficacy and quality of life, highlighting the shift toward holistic, individualized care.

The relationship between hearing impairment and dementia has attracted significant attention, the 2024 Lancet Commission report identifying hearing loss as the largest modifiable risk factor for dementia from mid-life. The nature of this linkage between dementia and hearing remains unclear and is likely to be complex. In principle, hearing impairment could cause (directly promote), catalyze (amplify) or be a consequence of neurodegenerative pathology and cognitive decline. Here we use this framework to examine different lines of evidence for the association between hearing impairment and dementia, and consider how this evidence speaks to potential mechanisms and treatment implications. We conclude by considering practical clinical implications for management of patients with hearing impairment and dementia, the potential role for central hearing tests as 'auditory biomarkers' of dementia, and the need for further collaborative and mechanistically motivated research in this area.

Herpes Zoster (HZ), caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), is a common infectious disease. Recent studies suggest a potential association between HZ and the development of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Epidemiological evidence indicates that HZ infection, especially in individuals with central nervous system involvement, may increase the risk of dementia. Pathologically, VZV may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration by inducing chronic neuroinflammation, infection-related cerebrovascular lesions, and direct central nervous system toxicity. HZ vaccines, particularly novel recombinant subunit vaccines (e.g., Shingrix), not only effectively prevent HZ but may also confer cognitive protection through mechanisms such as "trained immunity" activation and anti-inflammatory response modulation. Multiple natural experiments and retrospective cohort studies have found that HZ vaccination is significantly associated with a reduced risk of dementia, with particularly pronounced protective effects in women and older adults. Although most evidence currently stems from observational studies and is subject to potential confounding factors, the biological plausibility and consistent findings support the potential of HZ vaccination as an adjunctive strategy for dementia prevention. Future prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to further clarify the causal relationship and underlying neuroimmune mechanisms, providing a stronger evidence base for establishing scientific vaccination strategies for older adults and dementia prevention systems.

Evidence links air pollution to dementia, yet its role in Lewy body dementia (LBD) remains unclear. In this work, we showed in a cohort of 56.5 million individuals across the United States that fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) exposure raises LBD risk. Mechanistically, we found that PM(2.5) exposure led to brain atrophy in wild-type mice, an effect not seen in α-synuclein (αSyn)-deficient mice. PM(2.5) exposure generated a highly pathogenic αSyn strain, PM(2.5)-induced preformed fibril (PM-PFF), with enhanced proteinase K resistance and neurotoxicity, resembling αSyn LBD strains. PM(2.5) samples from China, the United States, and Europe consistently induced proteinase-resistant αSyn strains and in vivo pathology. Transcriptomic analyses revealed shared responses between PM(2.5)-exposed mice and LBD patients, underscoring PM(2.5)'s role in LBD and stressing the need for interventions to reduce air pollution and its associated neurological disease burden.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the association between chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) and the risk of dementia, addressing a significant gap in the existing literature and highlighting potential implications for clinical practice and public health. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Utilising data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, a propensity score-matched cohort study was conducted involving 142,682 patients who underwent major surgery between 2004 and 2018. CPSP was defined as prolonged analgesic use post-surgery, and dementia diagnosis was tracked until December 31, 2022. Multivariable Cox regression models were employed to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for dementia risk in CPSP versus non-CPSP groups. RESULTS: Before propensity score matching, the CPSP cohort (n = 37,438) exhibited a higher risk of dementia, with aHRs of 1.35 (95% CI: 1.30-1.40). After matching, the aHR remained elevated at 1.31 (95% CI: 1.26-1.37), indicating a significant association between CPSP and dementia risk. Subgroup analysis confirmed this association across various demographic and clinical factors, with sensitivity analysis reinforcing the robustness of the findings. CONCLUSION: This study establishes CPSP as an independent predictor of dementia risk, highlighting the importance of postoperative pain management in mitigating long-term cognitive outcomes. Approximately 30% of dementia risk post-CPSP presents an opportunity for risk reduction through effective CPSP management strategies, emphasising the need for targeted interventions to address this critical healthcare issue. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides compelling evidence that chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) significantly increases the risk of dementia, highlighting a critical and previously underexplored connection between postoperative pain and long-term cognitive decline. By establishing CPSP as an independent predictor of dementia, our findings underscore the importance of effective pain management strategies in surgical patients, particularly to mitigate the heightened risk of dementia and improve long-term outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: The increasing number of patients with dementia necessitates the development of rapid and convenient tools to assist with dementia diagnosis. We previously demonstrated the difference in the postural control characteristics during static standing among Alzheimer disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and vascular dementia (VaD). In this study, we evaluated the classification accuracy of the postural sway test to assess its capacity to distinguish between types of dementia. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Memory clinic outpatients aged 65-85 years who were clinically diagnosed with AD, DLB, VaD, and cognitively normal (CN) outpatients. METHODS: Static upright standing measurements were conducted under open- and closed-eye conditions to calculate 40 parameters. After variable selection based on statistical significance, 3 dementia classification models (AD vs DLB, AD vs VaD, and DLB vs VaD) based on postural control parameters were created. Bias-corrected accuracy measures using bootstraps were used for assessing the classification performances. RESULTS: The data of 1734 participants (1158 with AD, 105 with DLB, 46 with VaD, and 425 with CN) were analyzed. The area under the curves of receiver operating characteristic curves for AD vs DLB, AD vs VaD, and DLB vs VaD were 0.647 (0.646-0.649), 0.763 (0.761-0.765), and 0.659 (0.656-0.662), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Postural control characteristics differentiated between dementia types with reasonable to good accuracy, especially in the comparison between AD and VaD. Postural control testing may become a valuable assistive tool for dementia diagnosis in the future.

Recently, researchers have been interested in the potential connection between gut microbiota composition and various neuropsychological disorders. Dementia significantly affects the socioeconomics of families. Gut microbiota is considered as a probable factor in its pathogenesis. Multiple bacterial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, lipopolysaccharides, and various neurotransmitters that are responsible for the incidence and progression of dementia can be produced by gut microbiota. Various bacterial species such as Bifidobacterium breve, Akkermansia muciniphila, Streptococcus thermophilus, Escherichia coli, Blautia hydrogenotrophica, etc. are implicated in the pathogenesis of dementia. Gut microbiota can be a great target for imitating or inhibiting their metabolites as an adjunctive therapy based on their role in its pathogenesis. Therefore, some diets can prevent or decelerate dementia by altering the gut microbiota composition. Moreover, probiotics can modulate gut microbiota composition by increasing beneficial bacteria and reducing detrimental species. These therapeutic modalities are considered novel methods that are probably safe and effective. They can enhance the efficacy of traditional medications and improve cognitive function.

BACKGROUND: The frequency of salt added at the table (i.e., to food after it has been prepared, during consumption) could reflect an individual's long-term dietary preference and habitual intake in Western countries. However, little is known about the association between the frequency of salt added at the table and incident dementia. This study investigates the association of the frequency of salt added at the table with the risk of dementia and explores differences in the associations among people with apolipoprotein E ε4 genotypes. METHODS: Individuals indicated whether they added salt to their food at the table (salt used for cooking was not included) "never/rarely", "sometimes", "usually", or "always". Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute hazard ratios with 95 % confidence intervals and evaluate the association between the frequency of salt added at the table and incident dementia. RESULTS: We observed a graded relation between the frequency of salt added at the table and spot urine sodium concentrations and estimated 24-h sodium excretion. Over a median follow-up of 13.7 years, there were 9373 cases of all-cause dementia, including 4119 of Alzheimer's disease and 2052 of vascular dementia. With a higher frequency of salt added at the table, the risk of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia increased in a monotonic manner after adjustment for potential confounding factors (all P-trend <0.001). These associations of the frequency of salt added at the table with the risks of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia were greater in apolipoprotein E ε4 heterozygotes and homozygotes. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that a higher frequency of salt added at the table was associated with a higher risk of incident dementia. This positive association was more prominent among individuals with apolipoprotein E ε4 heterozygotes and homozygotes.

Community-based surveys conducted in Japan investigating the prevalence of dementia and its underlying causes revealed that dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) is the most common, followed by vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), mixed dementia, and other conditions including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Accurate differential diagnosis of these disorders requires clarification of their clinical characteristics. The initial symptoms of DAT typically include recent memory loss, episodic memory impairment, and temporal disorientation. Behavioral and psychological symptoms often observed in DAT include delusions of theft, "saving appearance" responses, and head-turning signs. Vascular dementia develops in association with cerebrovascular disease and frequently exhibits a stepwise progression. DLB is characterized by core clinical features such as cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and REM sleep behavior disorder. Diagnostic tools such as (123)Iodine-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy and dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging may aid in diagnosis. In Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), cognitive impairment appears more than one year after the onset of parkinsonism. FTLD involves degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes, leading to prominent changes in personality, behavior, and language function. Several subtypes of FTLD exist depending on the affected brain region, including the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, and progressive non-fluent aphasia. Idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is characterized by gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia, resulting from an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid. Pathologically confirmed cases of DLB and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) may occasionally present with symptoms resembling iNPH.

The critical need for early and precise detection of dementia, a crippling cognitive illness that primarily affects women, is addressed by this study. Global healthcare systems face enormous hurdles as dementia becomes more common. The need for non-invasive and effective alternatives is highlighted because current diagnostic techniques are frequently invasive, expensive, and imprecise. To address this issue, our work presents a unique method for female dementia identification from speech using multimodal Siamese networks. In contrast to earlier models, our approach uses both transcript and audio data, utilizing the complementary information present in both modalities. Improving dementia detection accuracy and reliability is the main driving force for this study, particularly in the early stages when intervention can be more successful. Additionally, the information used in this study includes 104 people in the control group, 208 people with a dementia diagnosis, and 85 whose diagnosis is uncertain. There are 238 control files and 298 dementia files in the audio dataset, and 243 control files and 306 dementia files in the transcript database. This extensive dataset makes it possible to evaluate our suggested model with confidence. Moreover, multimodal Siamese networks-a cutting-edge technique that captures relationships between multimodal data-are a part of the basic methodology used. Our model has a greater accuracy of 99% on the Dementia Bank Database, demonstrating considerable improvements over earlier approaches. The assessment parameters, encompassing an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.99, bolster the efficacy of our methodology. This paper will improve at-risk individuals' quality of life by developing non-intrusive dementia detection for early diagnosis and intervention.

Objective: Dementia diagnosis relies on assessing functional decline, yet widely used assessment tools are often developed in Euro-American contexts, limiting their cross-cultural validity. This commentary highlights key challenges in functional assessment across cultures and proposes a framework for enhancing their applicability and equity. Method: We critically examine methodological limitations in current functional assessment tools, including poor cultural adaptability, inadequate validation processes, and limited stakeholder engagement. Drawing on existing literature, we propose a multidimensional framework integrating cultural perceptions, robust adaptation strategies, and participatory approaches to improve assessment relevance. Conclusions: Functional assessments must balance cultural specificity with broad applicability to ensure accurate dementia detection across diverse populations. Identifying transcultural markers of functional decline, engaging local communities, and systematically adapting tools through rigorous validation will enhance their diagnostic utility. A culturally inclusive approach to functional assessment can reduce disparities in dementia diagnosis and care worldwide.

It is important to identify modifiable risk factors for dementia and to introduce policies to implement their modification. The Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention and Care failed to identify raised plasma homocysteine as a risk factor, despite considerable evidence; hence there is a need for a debate on this matter.

Vascular dementia is a highly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder induced by a variety of factors. Currently, there are no definitive treatments for the cognitive dysfunction associated with vascular dementia. However, early detection and preventive measures have proven effective in reducing the risk of onset and improving patient prognosis. Nitric oxide plays an integral role in various physiological and pathological processes within the central nervous system. In recent years, nitric oxide has been implicated in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and has emerged as a crucial factor in the pathophysiology of vascular dementia. At different stages of vascular dementia, nitric oxide levels and bioavailability undergo dynamic alterations, with a marked reduction in the later stages, which significantly contributes to the cognitive deficits associated with the disease. This review provides a comprehensive review of the emerging role of nitric oxide in the physiological and pathological processes underlying vascular dementia, focusing on its effects on synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and blood‒brain barrier integrity. Furthermore, we suggest that targeting the nitric oxide soluble guanylate cyclase-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway through specific therapeutic strategies may offer a novel approach for treating vascular dementia, potentially improving both cognitive function and patient prognosis. The review contributes to a better understanding of the multifaceted role of nitric oxide in vascular dementia and to offering insights into future therapeutic interventions.

Lewy body dementia (LBD) encompasses neurodegenerative dementias characterized by cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. Clinical differentiation of LBD from Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains complex due to symptom overlap, yet approximately 25% of dementia cases are diagnosed as LBD postmortem, primarily identified by the presence of α-synuclein aggregates, tau tangles, and amyloid plaques. These pathological features position LBD as a comorbid condition of both Parkinson's disease (PD) and AD, with over 50% of LBD cases exhibiting co-pathologies. LBD's mixed pathology complicates the development of comprehensive models that reflect the full spectrum of LBD's etiological, clinical, and pathological features. While existing animal and cellular models have facilitated significant discoveries in PD and AD research, they lack specificity in capturing LBD's unique pathogenic mechanisms, limiting the exploration of therapeutic avenues for LBD specifically. This review assesses widely used PD and AD models in terms of their relevance to LBD, particularly focusing on their ability to replicate human disease pathology and assess treatment efficacy. Furthermore, we discuss potential modifications to these models to advance the understanding of LBD mechanisms and propose innovative research directions aimed at developing models with enhanced etiological, face, predictive, and construct validity.

INTRODUCTION: Improved recognition of non-cognitive presentations of dementia could reduce inequalities in dementia diagnosis, particularly if sociocultural factors influence help-seeking for cognitive symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study using electronic healthcare records from primary care practices in East London, United Kingdom, to assess associations between prediagnostic presentations to primary care and subsequent dementia diagnosis. RESULTS: We included 4137 individuals with a dementia diagnosis and 15,754 controls in the matched analysis. In addition to memory difficulties, a range of symptoms were more common in the decade before diagnosis, including depression, anxiety, use of antipsychotics, insomnia, constipation, incontinence, hypotension, hearing loss, imbalance, and dizziness. DISCUSSION: A range of non-cognitive presentations are seen during the prodromal period of dementia in a diverse population. Improved recognition of these associations and their variation by ethnicity could increase access to dementia diagnosis through improved recognition of early features in people from different sociocultural backgrounds. HIGHLIGHTS: Prediagnostic signs of dementia include cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms are common up to a decade prior to a dementia diagnosis. Autonomic prediagnostic symptoms are more common among South Asian groups. The importance of prediagnostic symptoms of dementia varies by ethnicity.

The growing participation of older adults in travel is reshaping this industry and highlighting the need for inclusive travel experiences, particularly for people living with dementia (PLwD). While travel provides substantial physical, psychological, cognitive and social benefits that promote active and healthy ageing, it also presents significant challenges. Although physical disabilities are generally proactively addressed, more "hidden" cognitive difficulties often remain unrecognised and unaddressed. These include navigating complex environments, making timely decisions and relying on working memory-tasks that are further challenged by dynamic settings such as airports, train stations and bus terminals. Although efforts to create dementia-friendly travel experiences are underway, their implementation across travel infrastructure remains inconsistent. There is still much to be done to ensure this activity is accessible and inclusive for this population, and there is a need to advocate for a comprehensive, person-centred approach to dementia-friendly travel environments, emphasising the integration of tailored assessments, innovative technologies and coordinated global policies.

Eighteen family nurse practitioner students completed the Developing Empathic Experienced Providers dementia curriculum improvement project. The purpose was to examine the effects of a multicomponent curriculum designed to develop providers willing to work with older adults and to identify curriculum gaps. The project statistically and practically improved dementia knowledge, t(17) = 8.883, p ≤ .001, d = 2.221, and identified knowledge gaps in pharmacology and treatment content through pre- and postcontent evaluations. Minor improvements in attitude and intention to work with geriatric patients were identified using the Willingness to Work With Elderly People Scale.

OBJECTIVE: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) sagging brain syndrome is a disabling condition. An underlying spinal Cerebrospinal fluid leak can be identified in only a minority of patients and the success rate of non-directed treatments is low. Some of these patients have a remote history of craniectomy/cranioplasty and we report a positive response to custom implant cranioplasty revision many years after their initial cranioplasty. METHODS: We reviewed medical records and imaging studies of 61 consecutive patients with FTD sagging brain syndrome. A SIH Disability Assessment Score (SIHDAS) questionnaire was completed to assess the severity of the symptoms before and after custom implant cranioplasty. Pre- and post-operative brain MRI was obtained to assess degree of brain sagging. RESULTS: Eight (13.1%) of the 61 patients had a history of craniectomy/cranioplasty 1.5-13.5 years prior to onset of symptoms of FTD sagging brain syndrome. The mean age of the one woman and seven men at the time of presentation to our medical center was 50 years (range, 26-68 years). None had sinking scalp flap syndrome. Prior treatments included epidural blood patching and dural reduction surgery. Custom cranial implant surgery was performed in four patients and resulted in prompt and remarkable improvement of symptoms in three patients (SIHDAS: very severe disability to no or mild disability) and mild improvement in one patient. Brain MRI showed improvement of brain sagging. INTERPRETATION: A disproportionate number of patients with FTD sagging brain syndrome have a remote history of supratentorial craniectomy/cranioplasty and revision cranioplasty should be considered.

BACKGROUND: Primary care provides most dementia care, yet providing high-quality dementia care within this setting remains a challenge. Medicare and health system initiatives create opportunities to improve quality of dementia care. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate barriers and facilitators of high-quality dementia care in primary care with a secondary focus on interdisciplinary team-based primary care and health information technology. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews from July 2021 to January 2023. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen persons living with dementia (PLWD) and/or their 13 family caregivers, five primary care providers (PCPs), and 23 interdisciplinary primary care staff (nurses, medical assistants, care managers, social workers, pharmacists, practice administrators) across practices in a single health system. APPROACH: We used qualitative content analysis to identify barriers and facilitators to dementia care within a framework of factors affecting whether clinicians follow clinical practice guidelines and how interdisciplinary teams and technology may support dementia care. KEY RESULTS: Across all participants, there was limited knowledge of care practices and domains that constitute high-quality dementia care. Though PCP, staff, and caregiver attitudes were affected by their own prioritization of other medical conditions in primary care, all groups appreciated the importance of dementia care, and PCPs and staff were already addressing many relevant care domains. Barriers driving behavior were numerous and included time constraints, staffing challenges, and resource limitations in addition to patient or family-level factors. Interdisciplinary team-based care, telehealth, and patient portals can facilitate dementia care from PCP, staff, PLWD, and caregiver perspectives but interdisciplinary teams in particular are not yet used optimally. CONCLUSIONS: PCPs, interdisciplinary staff, PLWD, and caregivers identify numerous barriers to high-quality dementia care. Implementing dementia care and primary care initiatives, optimizing interdisciplinary team functioning, patient portal and telehealth use for dementia care, PCP/staff dementia training, and addressing well-known primary care challenges could improve dementia care in select settings.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the association between fish intake, n-3 PUFA, n-6 PUFA and risk of disabling dementia. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Municipalities within the Japan Public Health Centre-based Prospective Study. PARTICIPANTS: 43 651 participants: (20 002 men and 23 649 women). RESULTS: Exposure intake of fish, n-3 and n-6 PUFA was evaluated in 1995-1997. We defined disabling dementia cases as participants who were certified to receive disability care under the long-term-care insurance programme (2006-2016) in participating municipalities with a grade of activities of daily living related to dementia ≥ IIa on the dementia rating scale (range 0-IV and M). Cox proportional hazard models were applied to obtain hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % CI according to quartiles of exposures of interest. In the main analysis, we adjusted for age and area, smoking, BMI, alcohol and metabolic equivalent tasks. During 410 350 person-years of follow-up with an average follow-up of 9·4 years, 5278 cases of disabling dementia were diagnosed. Fish intake and most PUFA were not associated with the risk of disabling dementia in men. In women, n-6 PUFA showed a significant decreasing trend in risk the highest HR (95 % CI) compared with the lowest was 0·90 (0·81, 0·99) (P for trend = 0·024) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) was 0·91 (0·82, 1·00) (P for trend = 0·043). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest no association with fish in general and only n-6 PUFA and ALA may be associated with a decreased risk of disabling dementia especially in women.

BackgroundMetabolic syndrome (MetS) was associated with an increased incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and progression to dementia.ObjectiveTo study the associations between MetS indicators and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in the participants.Methods61 normal cognition, 66 mild MCI, and 135 dementia participants were included in our study, with the results of lumbar puncture and peripheral blood biochemistry. The CSF levels of amyloid-β (Aβ)(42) protein, total tau protein, phosphorylated tau protein, and Aβ(42/40) ratio, were selected as the biomarkers. The body mass index, the plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol, uric acid, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and homocysteine levels were selected as indicators of MetS. Linear regression model was used to analyze the correlation in all participants and different cognitive stages, controlling for age, gender, and APOE genotype.ResultsOur study showed that MetS indicators were associated with CSF biomarkers in participants after adjusting for possible confounding factors, including age, gender, and APOE genotype. The results of our grouping analysis further supported the potential association between plasma MetS indicators and CSF biomarkers in three group. We found that the dementia group showed the greatest correlation coefficient.ConclusionsThe CSF pathological proteins concentrations were associated with MetS indicators, and the correlation coefficient were greater in the dementia stage. These findings suggest that regulating peripheral metabolism may affect the level of pathological proteins in the brain to improve cognitive impairment.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of sociodemographic and clinical sex/gender-associated factors on dementia severity at the time of diagnosis. METHODS: Retrospective, cross-sectional study using 2007-2020 data from the Registry of Dementia of Girona (ReDeGi), collecting information from new dementia diagnoses in the seven hospitals of the Health Region of Girona (Northeast region of Catalonia, Spain). Sociodemographic and clinical variables were compared by sex and dementia severity at diagnosis. A multivariate analysis stratified by sex evaluated the risk of having a moderate/severe dementia diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 9614 new dementia cases, 6040 (62.8%) were women, and 3574 (37.2%) were men. Women and men aged 75-85 years had 27.9% (p = .003) and 43.1% (p < .001) less risk of moderate/severe diagnosis, respectively, than those >85. Being institutionalized increased the risk of moderate/severe diagnosis more in women (159.9%; p < .001) than in men (114.8%; p = .030). Being single and having a higher education increased the risk of moderate/severe diagnosis by 76.2% (p = .039) and 69.8% (p = .021), respectively, only in women. CONCLUSIONS: Age, education level, marital status, and place of residence were differentially associated with moderate/severe dementia at the time of diagnosis in women and men, indicating sex/gender differences in dementia severity at diagnosis, with an increased impact on women.

BACKGROUND: Up to one-third of dementia cases may be preventable, with evidence suggesting that modifying lifestyle and health behaviors can significantly lower the risk of developing dementia. However, motivating older adults to adopt and sustain these changes poses a considerable challenge, particularly when facing the specter of dementia. AIM: To explore the interaction effect between dementia fear and dementia literacy on the perceived ability of community-dwelling older adults to reduce dementia risk and engage in dementia screening. METHOD: A cross-sectional study involving 1,067 community-dwelling older adults was conducted from August 2022 to December 2023. Participants completed surveys assessing their dementia literacy, personal dementia fear, motivation to change lifestyle and health behaviors, and willingness to engage in investigational screening for memory in primary care. FINDINGS: Personal dementia fear exhibited significant positive correlations with motivation to change lifestyle and health behavior (r = 0.621, p < 0.001) and investigational screening for memory in primary care (r = 0.559, p < 0.001), indicating that higher levels of fear are associated with increased motivation. Second, dementia literacy demonstrated positive correlations with motivation to change lifestyle and health behavior (r = 0.349, p < 0.001) and investigational screening (r = 0.269, p < 0.001), suggesting that more excellent knowledge enhances perceived ability. Lastly, both dementia literacy and personal dementia fear were positively correlated with motivation to change health behaviors, with respective effects of β = 0.266 and β = 0.595, highlighting their interactive role in shaping perceptions of risk reduction and screening. IMPLICATION: The significant contributions of dementia literacy, personal dementia fear, and their interaction highlight the importance of these factors in accepting investigational screening for memory in primary care.

BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests statins may influence cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but specific use patterns in AD patients remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To identify factors influencing statin use in AD and explore associations between statins, cholesterol, and cognition, evaluated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at dementia diagnosis. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using data from the Swedish Registry for Dementia and Cognitive Disorders (SveDem) and Stockholm Creatinine Measurements (SCREAM) from 2007 to 2018. Multivariable logistic regression examined associations between baseline characteristics and statin use, while linear regression analyzed relationships between statins, cholesterol levels, and MMSE scores. RESULTS: We included 3074 AD patients (mean age 78.1 years; 59.4% women), of whom 1028 used statins (79.6% simvastatin, 20.4% atorvastatin). Patients with diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, or stroke had greater odds of receiving statins. Older patients had slightly lower odds of receiving any statin at baseline (simvastatin use OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99). Simvastatin users had 0.53 points higher MMSE on average at baseline compared to non-users of statins (se 0.23, p = 0.021). Higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were associated with higher MMSE in non-users of statins, but not in statin users. CONCLUSIONS: Younger AD patients and those with cardiovascular disease were more likely to use statins. Simvastatin use was linked to higher cognitive scores at diagnosis. In non-users, higher LDL-C, TC, and HDL-C levels correlated with better baseline cognitive scores. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the effects of statins on cognitive decline in AD.

OBJECTIVE: Hispanic/Latino/a/x (hereafter Latino) persons living in the U.S. are at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) compared to non-Latino Whites. Early detection of preclinical changes is crucial. The SALUD-Tech study aims to identify digital behavioral markers-"digital signatures"-of ADRD risk in diverse middle-aged and older Latinos using passive data from smartphones and smartwatches. METHODS: Participants include Latino adults aged 50-70 years living in southern California, with varying degrees of ADRD risk as defined by the presence of mild cognitive impairment and cardiovascular disease risk. Data collection began in April 2022 and will continue through 2026. Participants complete comprehensive laboratory assessments (neurobehavioral, medical, sociocultural, and psychiatric assessments). High-frequency data on sensors, keyboard dynamics, and phone use activity are collected for 30 days following the baseline visit. A subset of study participants completes 18- and 36-month longitudinal assessments; these participants are selected based on risk profiles and retention likelihood. All data are securely encrypted, de-identified, and collected respecting participant privacy and consent in accordance with ethical standards. Data analysis involves integrating multimodal data streams using machine learning to identify behavioral patterns associated with early cognitive decline. RESULTS: We anticipate 300 participants will be enrolled in the study. Study results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. DISCUSSION: Early detection of ADRD risk using smartphone and wearable data could help reduce disparities by providing a low-cost, accessible tool. Ultimately, this approach may be integrated into clinical care to enable earlier interventions and reduce healthcare costs.

Dementia is a general term for loss of memory, ling and other thinking abilities that are severe enough to interfere with daily life. It is very crucial to distinguish the different forms of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at phenotypic and genetic level. In India, the estimated prevalence of dementia for adults more than 60 years old is reported to be 7.4%. It is known that immune response gets compromised with age and this brings the immune hypothesis into the core of neurodegeneration, that need critical investigation. To address this concern a battery of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokine gene variants was screened in patients diagnosed with AD (n = 150), FTD (n = 65) and MCI (n = 70) and compared with age-matched cognitively normal controls (n = 250) from a clinical cohort of South India (Kerala). The genotyping results show that rs1800796 GG and GC genotypes in IL-6 may confer a genetic susceptibility for AD group, whereas IL-1β, rs1143634, IL-6 promoter variants, rs1800795 (G allele) and rs1800796 (GC genotype) and three TNF variants, rs361525 (AA genotype), rs1800629 (GG genotype) and rs1799964 (CC genotype and C allele) could play an important role in the susceptibility to MCI group. In FTD, TNF promoter variant rs1800629 AA genotype showed a significant association compared to controls. These findings suggest that proinflammatory cytokine gene variations may confer variable risk for AD, MCI and FTD in the analyzed population, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The environmental and inflammatory threshold are defined by genetic risk variants of inflammation. Identifying genetic risk factors for inflammation might help in defining how age and chronicity of inflammation can define and distinguish dementia and its subtypes.

BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of Donepezil in mild to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been widely studied, but research on very mild dementia (VMD) remains limited. OBJECTIVE: This retrospective observational study evaluated the efficacy of Donepezil in patients with VMD in two hospitals in southern Taiwan between 2011 and 2019. METHODS: We recruited 909 VMD patients with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0.5 and used propensity score matching to create two groups: 352 receiving Donepezil and 352 not. Demographic data, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and healthcare costs were analyzed over 1-year and 3-year periods. RESULTS: At baseline, Donepezil treatment was associated with lower inpatient, outpatient, and overall healthcare costs. After 1 year, outpatient drug costs increased, while inpatient drug costs decreased, leading to higher overall healthcare drug costs. Over 3 years, outpatient drug continued to rise, while inpatient drug costs remained stable, leading to higher overall healthcare drug costs. Donepezil users had significantly more outpatient visits, but inpatient admissions were unaffected. Patients receiving Donepezil were older and had lower MMSE; male gender, Parkinsonism, chronic lung disease, and liver disease were less common in this group. CONCLUSIONS: Although Donepezil users initially had lower healthcare costs, overall healthcare drug costs increased in the Donepezil group at both the 1-year and 3-year follow-ups, while inpatient drug costs were only reduced in the short term.

BackgroundPatients with dementia face driving difficulties and, at some point, cease driving.ObjectiveWe sought to identify predictors of driving cessation among patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD).MethodsWe enrolled in this longitudinal study patients with MCI, AD (Clinical Dementia Rating < 2) and cognitively normal (NC) individuals. At baseline evaluation, participants underwent a neurological, neuropsychological and driving simulator assessment. Re-evaluations after 48 and 84 months included a structured interview with the patients and their caregiver. Primary endpoints were driving cessation, death and progression to dementia.Results109 individuals were included (32 NC, mean age 65.8 years/47 MCI, mean age 69.1 years/30 AD, mean age 72.8 years). Dangerous driving events during follow-up were referred for 45% and 59% of MCI and AD patients, respectively. 18 MCI (38%, mean time to cease 35 months) and 25 AD (83%, mean time to cease 15 months) patients ceased driving during follow-up. 36% of MCI patients progressed to dementia during follow-up. Cox Regression multivariate analysis revealed age (Hazard Ratio-HR 1.080), semantic verbal fluency-SVF (HR 0.822) and Tandem Walking Test modified with simultaneous reverse number counting-mTWT (HR 1.099) as significant predictors of driving cessation. Simulator accident probability reached statistical significance only in the univariate model (HR 1.040).ConclusionsAge, SVF and mTWT are significant predictors of driving cessation among MCI and AD patients. Driving simulator may be a promising component of driving evaluation. Large-scale studies are prerequisite for the implementation of a multi-disciplinary driving fitness evaluation protocol.

The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system is known for its role in cognitive functions and memory processes. However, the activity of GABA(A) receptors and their associated pathways influence the accumulation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), a key hallmark in the development and prognosis of research examining the relationship between the use of drugs affecting GABA(A) receptors and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. This study aimed to examine the association between GABAA receptor-affecting drugs and the risk of AD and dementia, focusing on benzodiazepines, zolpidem, and anesthetics. This meta-analysis included all English articles on AD, dementia, and GABA(A) receptor agonist medications published before May 2024. The articles were identified through searches conducted on PubMed and Scopus databases. The extracted data were analyzed using STATA software (version 14.2). Q statistics and the I(2) index were used to evaluate heterogeneity, while Egger's test and funnel plot were utilized to detect publication bias. A total of 19 articles (10 case-control and 9 cohort articles) were eligible for the analysis, involving 2,953,980 patients. The use of GABA agonists was found to have a statistically significant relationship with the development of dementia (RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.02-1.29, I(2) = 87.6%) and AD (RR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.40, I(2) = 97.6%). In the drug-based subgroup, we observed that zolpidem consumption was associated with an increased incidence of AD and dementia (RR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.08-1.52, I(2) = 24.3%), similar to the effects of benzodiazepines (BZDs; RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04-1.18, I(2) = 87.2%). Meta-regression analysis showed that the duration of follow-up, which ranged from 5 to 11 years across the studies, was significantly associated with heterogeneity (P = 0.036). Our findings indicate that the use of zolpidem and BZD is associated with an increased risk of dementia and AD.

BACKGROUND: Diet plays an important role in the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is regarded as one way to reduce risk. Fish is a component of the Mediterranean diet. Participant variables change with time, resulting in "regression dilution". OBJECTIVE: The objective is to investigate the role of follow-up period after measurement of dietary fish intake with risk of AD and dementia. METHODS: A recent meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies is used to examine this effect for dietary fish and incidence of dementia and AD. RESULTS: For seven dementia studies with mean follow-up periods from one to ten years, the regression fit to the data is relative risk (RR) = 0.19 + (0.087 × Follow up [years], r = 0.84, adjusted r(2 ) = 0.66, p = 0.009). However, when mean age of the participants was added to the analysis, the effect of follow-up period became non-significant. For five AD studies with follow-up periods from 3.9 to 9.8 years, the regression fit to the data is RR = 0.11 + (0.095 × follow up [years]), r = 0.93, adjusted r(2 ) = 0.87, p = 0.02). The RR for the regression fit to the shortest follow-up periods are 40% greater for dementia than the standard meta-analysis suggests and 70% greater for AD. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective cohort studies of diet and health outcomes should reassess variables every few years. Meta-analyses should consider the effect of mean follow-up periods and mean age of the participants during follow up.

Highly sensitive plasma assays enable accurate blood-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative disease and provide minimally invasive options for clinical use. Large-scale studies encompassing multiple neurodegenerative diseases and utilizing multiplex platforms are essential to uncover disease-specific biomarkers and pathways. We generated and analyzed plasma proteomics using the NULISASeq(™) CNS Disease Panel 120 from 3,002 participants with Alzheimer disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson disease (PD) and cognitively unimpaired participants at the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center. We identified proteins associated with disease status and AD-related phenotypes (Clinical Dementia Rating(®) [CDR(®)], CSF Aβ42/Aβ40, amyloid-PET, and tau-PET tauopathy), which were used to identify disease-specific biomarkers and perform pathway analyses. Among the 123 measured protein, 78 were associated with AD, two with DLB, two with FTD, and one with PD after multiple test correction. Disease comparison showed that AD and DLB showed the highest similarity, followed by FTD and DLB. At the same time there were also disease-specific signatures. Some AD-specific proteins include p-tau217 being AD-specific, MME was specific for FTD, CHR for DLB and PARK7 for PD. We also identified 8 proteins associated with Amyloid PET, 7 with Tau PET, 14 with CSF Aβ42/40 ration and 73 with CDR, with Amyloid PET and CDR showing the highest overlap. As few extensive plasma p-tau217 studies have been performed with the NULISA platform, we used a data-driven approach to establish the cut-off for biomarker positivity, and analyze its predictivity performance for clinical status and amyloid-PET. Plasma p-tau217 achieved an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79-0.83) for AD diagnosis and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93-0.98) for amyloid positivity. Using a two-cutoff approach, plasma p-tau217 had an AUC of 0.95 and 93.59% agreement with amyloid-PET status. Proteins associated with AD were enriched on vascular endothelial growth factor receptor binding, mainly driven by VEGFD and VEGFA. Cell death and apoptosis pathways were unique to FTD and driven by CCL2 and TREM2, and PD was enriched on enzymatic activity and metal ion binding. This is the largest plasma proteomic investigation to date, incorporating p-tau217 and utilizing the NULISA platform to understand neurodegenerative diseases. It validates the high classification accuracy of plasma p-tau217 and its strong correlation with amyloid PET status. Additionally, we identify disease-specific proteins that could enhance differential diagnosis. These findings underscore the potential of the NULISA platform as a reliable quantitative tool for research and clinical applications in neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Identifying individuals at risk for dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the general population (GP) is increasingly essential due to new diagnostic criteria and opportunities for effective interventions. Plasma-based biomarkers (pBB) offer a promising approach for detecting positive amyloid profile. However, their effectiveness in predicting clinical dementia and AD risk at the GP level remains largely unexplored. OBJECTIVES: To assess the risk of clinical dementia and AD using pBB amyloid biomarkers in GP using the most up-to-date proteomic techniques. DESIGN: Case-cohort study randomly selected from a prospective cohort. SETTING: The three-city community-living study. PARTICIPANTS: Over 65 years recruited from the electoral rolls of three French cities. MEASUREMENTS: pBB amyloid levels (Aβ42, Aβ40 and APP669-711) were measured in the plasma using the mass spectrometry-based (IPMS)-Shimadzu modified technology. Patients were monitored for up to 6 years for incident dementia and AD according to DSM-IV and NINCDS/ADRDA criteria. Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for multiple covariables, including age and renal function, were used to estimate hazard ratios. RESULTS: Plasma samples from 327 participants were analyzed with a mean age 83 years (80-87), 64.8 % females and a median follow-up time of 2.7 years (0.8-4.8) and including 121 incident dementia cases. Our findings indicate that the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, along with a composite score that encompasses APP669-711 and Aβ40/Aβ42 ratios, serves as significant predictors of clinical dementia [HR(95 %CI) = 3.52 (1.69-7.32), p-value<0.001 and 4.34 (2.06-9.17), p-value<0.001, respectively] and AD risk over a six-year period, while also accounting for age and sex interactions. Furthermore, elevated Aβ40 levels correlate with an increased risk of developing dementia (HR=2.56, 95 % CI 1.22-5.35, p = 0.01) and AD (HR=2.60, 95 %CI 1.06-6.36, p = 0.04), and our study confirms that Aβ42 concentrations are significantly influenced by renal function. CONCLUSIONS: This research advances the potential application of plasma amyloid biomarkers for assessing the risk of clinical dementia and AD in the general population within short period of time, positioning it as a valuable tool alongside existing plasma PT217 biomarkers or using ratio of both of them.

BACKGROUND: Studies have observed that individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) tend to have lower lean mass and higher rates of sarcopenia. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to assess differences in lean mass, sarcopenia, and its components between individuals with AD and those without dementia (WD). METHODS: Searches were conducted in the Medline, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus and Latin American and Caribbean Health Scientific Literature. Observational studies comparing lean mass, sarcopenia, and its components in the populations of interest were included. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scale to assess methodological quality. Mean differences (MD) and standardized mean differences were calculated for the meta-analyses. RESULTS: Four studies with 2035 individuals found that those with AD had significantly lower upper and lower limb lean mass, and skeletal muscle mass index compared to WD individuals. AD individuals also had a higher sarcopenia prevalence (41.33% versus 20.66%) and significant reductions in handgrip strength, lower limb muscle strength, and gait speed compared to WD individuals. The JBI scale analysis showed high agreement among the studies (k = 1.00, p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with AD have lower lean mass, higher rates of sarcopenia, and reduced muscle function compared to those without dementia. While the results suggest the need for early screening programs and integrated therapeutic interventions to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for individuals with AD, it is important to consider that biases inherent in observational studies may compromise the quality of the evidence. Therefore, further research, preferably clinical trials, is needed to confirm these associations.

INTRODUCTION:  The Recruitment and Retention of Alzheimer's Disease Diversity Genetic Cohorts in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (READD-ADSP) was established to bridge the gap in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) research in Africa. We examined the role of Community Advisory Boards (CABs) in improving participant recruitment and retention in ADRD research in Africa, by exploring how culturally sensitive engagement, community trust-building, and stakeholder involvement influence research participation. METHODS:  A multi-site, multi-phased qualitative study approach that involved establishment of CABs, initial planning meetings and community engagement cum recruitment activities. RESULTS:  Twenty-one CABs (141 members) were established across 14 study sites in 9 African Dementia Consortium (AfDC) member countries. Co-creation planning meetings, culturally sensitive outreaches for brain health, dementia awareness creation, and recruitment were held. DISCUSSION:  Establishing CABs within the READD-ADSP project has proven instrumental in co-creating culturally appropriate and community-centered strategies for recruitment and retention in ADRD research in Africa. HIGHLIGHTS: The Recruitment and Retention of Alzheimer's Disease Diversity Genetic Cohorts in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (READD-ADSP) project utilizes a community-engaged research (CER) framework to develop a community engagement program and establish Community Advisory Boards (CABs) to enhance participant recruitment and retention. There is a need to standardize CER practices and promote context-sensitive and culturally appropriate CE activities across African Dementia Consortium (AfDC) sites to ensure cultural sensitivity and enhance recruitment and retention. The project seeks to empower CABs to promote national dementia policies by collaborating with policy-makers and advancing equitable dementia scienced and care in Africa.

Age-related cognitive impairment and dementia pose a significant global health, social, and economic challenge. While Alzheimer's disease (AD) has historically been viewed as the leading cause of dementia, recent evidence reveals the considerable impact of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), which now accounts for nearly half of all dementia cases. The Mediterranean diet-characterized by high consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and olive oil-has been widely recognized for its cardiovascular benefits and may also reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. To investigate the protective effects of the Mediterranean diet on cognitive health, we conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, focusing on studies published between 2000 and 2024. The studies included in the meta-nalysis examined the adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the incidence of dementia and AD. We applied a random-effects model to calculate pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and assessed heterogeneity through I-square statistics. Forest plots, funnel plots, and Z-score plots were used to visualize study outcomes. Of the 324 full-text records reviewed, 23 studies met the inclusion criteria. The combined HR for cognitive impairment among those adhering to the Mediterranean diet was 0.82 (95% CI 0.75-0.89); for dementia, the HR was 0.89 (95% CI 0.83-0.95); and for AD, the HR was 0.70 (95% CI 0.60-0.82), indicating substantial protective effects. Significant heterogeneity was observed across studies, though Z-score plots suggested sufficient sample sizes to support reliable conclusions for each condition. In conclusion, this meta-analysis confirms that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with an 11-30% reduction in the risk of age-related cognitive disorders, including cognitive impairment, dementia, and AD. These findings underscore the Mediterranean diet's potential as a central element in neuroprotective public health strategies to mitigate the global impact of cognitive decline and dementia and to promote healthier cognitive aging.

Recent studies suggest that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) contribute to the predisposition to, protection from, and potential treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we used electronic health records (EHR) from two different health systems to examine whether heparin therapy was associated with a delayed diagnosis of AD dementia. Longitudinal EHR data from 15,183 patients from the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) and 6207 patients from Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) were used in separate survival analyses to compare those who did or did not receive heparin therapy, had a least 5 years of observation, were at least 65 years old by their last visit, and had subsequent diagnostic code or drug treatment evidence of possible AD dementia. Analyses controlled for age, sex, comorbidities, follow-up duration and number of inpatient visits. Heparin therapy was associated with significant delays in age of clinical diagnosis of AD dementia, including +1.0 years in the MSMS cohort (P < 0.001) and +1.0 years in the CUMC cohort (P < 0.001). While additional studies are needed, this study supports the potential roles of heparin-like drugs and HSPGs in the protection from and prevention of AD dementia.

BACKGROUND: Studies have examined the association between dual sensory impairment and late-life cognitive outcomes in the U.S with inconsistent findings. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between sensory impairment and 10-year risk of dementia or Alzheimer's disease among U.S. adults aged ≥ 50. METHODS: A prospective cohort study based on the Health and Retirement Study from 2010 to 2020. Individuals aged ≥ 50 years without self-reported dementia and Alzheimer's disease in 2010 were included in the analysis. Self-reported visual and hearing impairments were measures in 2010. Main failure events included self-reported incident dementia and Alzheimer's disease over a 10-year follow-up period. Participants were categorized as having no visual or hearing impairment, visual impairment only, hearing impairment only, and dual sensory impairment. Fine-Gray competing risk regression model was applied to estimate the associations of sensory impairment with incident dementia and Alzheimer's disease, adjusted for demographic characteristics, health behaviors, and health conditions at baseline. RESULTS: Of 20,248 identified individuals, 14.6% had visual impairment only, 11.2% had hearing impairment only, and 9.1% had dual impairment at baseline. After adjusting for all covariates, dual sensory impairment was associated with higher risk of dementia (HR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.23-1.73) and Alzheimer's disease (HR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.03-1.76). Visual impairment only was also associated with incident dementia and Alzheimer's disease among individuals <65 years. CONCLUSION: Older adults in the U.S. with visual and hearing impairments simultaneously had a particularly greater risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, indicating the needs of targeted screening for timely treatment and further prevention of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

The Swedish Registry for Cognitive/Dementia Disorders (SveDem) follows the quality and equity of dementia care across Sweden. In this study, we investigated temporal trends in sex-based differences in the provision of dementia care. Outcomes were diagnostic work-up, assessments performed by health care professionals, medication use, and social support (defined as initiating contact with a social worker and/or support to relatives). Revisions in dementia diagnosis between baseline and follow-up were evaluated as a marker of diagnostic stability. We included 100,534 individuals diagnosed with dementia between 2008 and 2021 (median age 80 years, 58% women). Dementia registrations rose from 2008 to 2014, then declined after 2015. Alzheimer's dementia was more frequent in women than men (35% versus 17%), while vascular dementia was less frequent (17% versus 21%). Small differences were observed in dementia care outcomes between sexes. Where differences reached statistical significance, effect sizes were minimal. Dementia diagnosis was revised in 5% of men and 4% of women over a median period of 11 months between baseline and first follow-up. Our results revealed negligible temporal trends in sex-based differences in dementia care among individuals included in the SveDem. However, as SveDem covers only about one third of Sweden's dementia population, findings may not fully represent national trends.

Despite growing attention to well-being in dementia, few studies have defined meaning-based (eudaimonic) well-being in this population, mainly due to challenges posed by cognitive decline and self-report limitations. We developed and validated a novel tool for measuring meaning-based well-being in individuals with dementia, particularly those receiving residential or home care. The study included two samples: carers of 174 care home residents and carers of 420 community-dwelling individuals for whom respondents reported dementia. The Well-being in Dementia Inventory (WiDI) assesses six core dimensions: Self-Sufficiency, Functional Mastery, Goal-Based Mastery, Purposeful Engagement, Positive Interactions and Constructive Self-Perspective. Confirmatory Factor Analysis established the WiDI's six-factor structure, underscoring its multidimensional nature and equivalence across community-dwelling individuals, regardless of gender, age group (younger-old/mid-older-old), or care context (family or professional). The scale exhibited high internal and inter-rater reliability, though very low scores in the care home sample inflated these statistics. Concurrent validity was confirmed through strong correlations with adapted indices of meaning-based well-being (e.g. the Scales of Psychological Well-being and the Mental Health Continuum Short Form, commonly used in non-dementia samples), indicating the WiDI's conceptual consistency. These findings clarify how meaning-based well-being can be assessed in individuals with dementia and introduce the WiDI as a reliable and valid tool for assessing well-being, suggesting broad applicability across care settings. These results have important implications for practice and policy, advocating a meaning-based approach to well-being assessments that ensures holistic, personalised care by focusing on key indicators of life quality.

The human DNA double helix is wrapped around proteins known as histones, which play a critical role in regulating gene expression. The goal of this opinion piece is to provide an overview of how histone sensing drives Alzheimer's disease (AD). Histones are proteins enriched in basic amino acids. Histone acetylation plays an important role in the progression of AD as its dysregulation can lead to neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, abnormal histone acetylation, a post-translation modification, is a key factor in AD as it contributes to brain cell inflammatory pathology. Thus, higher levels of histone acetylation could potentially serve as important biomarkers for the progression of AD. Here, we report that increased levels of acetylation of histones H2B, H3, and H4 in the promoter regions of Tip60 lysine acetyltransferase protein, p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP), GCN5-related N-acetyltransferases, p300/CBP-associated factor, elongator protein 3, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and Tau genes in the hippocampus and temporal lobe are associated with the development of AD-associated learning and memory impairment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common chronic neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by (1) plaques, (2) neuronal death, (3) hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, and (4) memory deficits. Despite extensive research, the underlying cause of AD is not fully understood. Evidence that infectious pathogens may trigger AD has been documented for decades. There are notable correlations between microbes (including bacteria, viruses, and fungi) and AD pathologies. Although it is yet to be determined if pathogenic microbes are the causative agent or a contributing factor to AD, the role of infections in the pathogenesis of AD should not be ignored. Even though the pathogens may not cause AD, they may play a direct role in the triggering or exacerbation of AD progression. In this mini review, the current status of pathogens' role in AD etiology will be presented.

Cells and nervous system connections that are crucial for movement, coordination, strength, sensation, and thought are gradually damaged in neurodegenerative illnesses. Amyloid beta (Aβ)- accumulating macromolecules in the brain are the primary cause of the disease's chronic symptoms, according to analysis carried out during the last 20 years. Plaques and clumps of amyloid- build up in the brain, obstructing neuronal signals and destroying neural connections. Tau, a protein that results in the formation of "neurofibrillary tangles" in the brain, another hallmark of neuronal death, has been the focus of a lot of research. Dendrimers Delivery (DDs) is one of the most promising advancements in nanotechnology for biomedical applications, particularly drug delivery. Some of the main categories of dendrimers employed in the successful management of neurodegenerative illnesses are polyamidoamine dendrimers (PAMAM) dendrimers, polypropylenimine dendrimers (PPI), Poly-l-lysine dendrimers (PLL), and carbosilane dendrimers. The tight blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits the entry of medications or therapeutic agents, makes it difficult to treat central nervous system disorders. Dendrimers have attracted the attention of scientists more than other non-invasive methods of drug delivery across the BBB and improve the uptake of medicines in the brain's target tissues. The major benefits of dendrimers include their adaptability, biocompatibility, ability to load pharmaceuticals into the core and surface, and nanosize. The patents provide "composition of matter" protection for Starpharma's dendrimer technologies for drug delivery out to 2029 in the United States, which is the world's largest pharmaceutical market for several important drug classes. This review has updated the status of the patent and clinical trials literature pertaining to dendrimer use in AD.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) are commonly seen in individuals with dementia and can often worsen outcomes. Therefore, there is a need for an increase in the understanding of the factors at interplay with NPSs, such as neurobiology. The objective of this study was to examine how vascular burdens and dementia biomarkers are linked to NPSs. Patients with dementia in outpatient services were included in the study. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was used to evaluate NPSs. Vascular burdens were represented by clinical vascular diseases, and the severity of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) was assessed using Fazekas score in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Additionally, ApoE genotypes and visual ratings of medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) in brain MRI imaging were used to represent dementia biomarkers. Altogether, forty-five patients with dementia were enrolled in this study, with the majority of dementia types being AD (80%), followed by Vad (8.9%), DLB (8.9%), and FTD (2.2%). The results revealed that depression symptoms were associated with vascular diseases (p = 0.03). Additionally, anxiety symptoms (p = 0.03) and the depression/apathy cluster (p = 0.03) were correlated with MRI Fazekas score. For dementia biomarkers, agitation was associated with ApoE ε4 (p = 0.02).Our findings revealed that individual NPSs such as depression and anxiety, as well as the NPSs cluster of depression/apathy, correlated with vascular burden. Additionally, agitation was associated with ApoE ε4.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The 2024 Lancet Commission estimates 45% of dementias worldwide are preventable if 14 potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia were eliminated. While this is unlikely, there is evidence that even modest risk factor reduction will have significant benefits. Whether this is best achieved at the level of the individual or broader population level approaches is the purpose of this review. RECENT FINDINGS: To date, evidence for the efficacy of individual-level interventions in preventing cognitive decline or dementia is modest at best. Reasons for this include the sociodemographic and risk profile of study participants and complex disease causes, while overlooking the underlying social and commercial determinants of health influencing risk exposure. There is, however, growing evidence supporting population-level approaches to dementia risk reduction. Trend studies from high-income countries showing declines in dementia incidence over recent decades suggest their effectiveness. SUMMARY: The limited evidence for the efficacy, let alone effectiveness, of individual-level interventions is in part because they operate within the influence of social and commercial determinants of health. For significant and sustained risk factor reduction, population-level interventions targeting the underlying determinants of risk factor exposure across the life course, with sensitivity to diverse contexts, are required.

Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common cause of dementia. Few bioinformatic analysis has been done to explore its biomarkers. This study aimed to excavate potential biomarkers for VaD using bioinformatic analysis and validate them at both animal and patient levels. Based on microarray data of GSE122063, bioinformatic analysis revealed 502 DEGs in the frontal and 674 DEGs in the temporal cortex of VaD patients. Afterward, the hub genes between two regions, including C1QA, C1QB, C1QC, and C5AR1, were dugout. Interestingly, compared with sham mice or controls, the above four complements were highly expressed in the cortices of VaD animals and in the peripheral serum of VaD patients. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis conformed to good diagnostic powers of these complements, with C1QB having the most prominent capacity (AUC = 0.799, 95%CI 0.722-0.875). That means the complements, especially subunits of C1Q, might be used as specific early VaD diagnostic biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION: As one of the most rapidly aging societies globally, Korea's efforts to mitigate the social burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) may provide valuable insights. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods review of studies and policies related to dementia care in Korea over the past 25 years, including quantitative analysis of administrative and comparative data. RESULTS: Estimates suggest a high social burden from ADRD, with annual costs increasing from 0.9% to 3.8% of gross domestic product between 2019 and 2050. Pilot programs for integrated community care and hospice palliative care reveal the advantages of innovating from a foundation of national health insurance and long-term care insurance, as well as the continuing challenges of appropriately designing programs and incentives for early detection, integrated care, and late-life palliative care. DISCUSSION: A rigorous analysis of programs addressing uneven quality and a study of the impact of integrated care models for home- and community-based services would be valuable. HIGHLIGHTS: A mixed-method review highlights the challenges of rapid aging in Korea. Universal health and long-term care systems support innovation for dementia care. Dementia costs are projected to increase from 0.9% to 3.8% of gross domestic product in 2019-2050. Pilots of integrated community care and hospice palliative care show promise. Rigorous analysis of programs to address uneven quality would be valuable.

Altered mental status is one of the most common presenting complaints in older adult patients and is often related to "3 Ds": delirium, dementia, and depression. Out of the 3 Ds, delirium and dementia are more commonly encountered in clinical practice. The 2 terms are frequently used interchangeably and, therefore, unrecognized during the initial assessment. Understanding that delirium and dementia are distinct syndromes with different prognoses and management is essential, though distinguishing between both diagnoses in the clinical setting can be difficult, even for experienced clinicians. While an acute confusional state that fluctuates and develops over days to weeks is likely to be delirium, a more persistent and chronic progression is more suggestive of dementia; however, these clinical features may not be as evident in patients with underlying dementia who develop acute delirium. Additionally, this distinction is blurred in cases of persistent delirium and reversible dementia etiologies. Cognition is assessed in 6 domains: memory and learning, language, executive functioning, complex attention, perceptual-motor, and social cognition.  Delirium is characterized by an altered awareness mainly affecting attention, whereas dementia is defined as cognitive decline, which interferes with 1 or more domains. Delirium is an abrupt onset of reduced orientation or awareness of the environment in contrast to dementia, a gradual process leading to disturbance in the core features, with attention being affected much later in the disease course.  Typically, dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder seen in older age and is of various subtypes, with the age of onset depending on the subtype. On the other hand, delirium is an age-independent process that occurs more commonly in older adult patients and can happen under variable circumstances. Delirium typically occurs from hours to days, whereas dementia is a slow progressive course over months to years. Delirium and dementia commonly coexist, with preexisting dementia being a leading risk factor for delirium. Sometimes, when dementia is rapidly progressive, it can be challenging to differentiate between the conditions in patients without a prior history of dementia. Therefore, distinguishing between these conditions or identifying superimposed delirium in a preexisting dementia patient is essential, as misdiagnosis may lead to a prolonged hospital stay, accelerated cognitive and functional decline, increased healthcare costs, and even death.

Rationale: Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome-mediated effector plays critical roles in multiple disease pathologies. While nanotechnology has revolutionized therapeutic development through novel approaches, the potential regulatory effects of nanoparticles on AIM2 inflammasome activity remain unexplored. Here, guided by clinical patient data and computational modeling, we developed an AIM2 inflammasome-targeting biomimetic mineralization inhibitor for vascular dementia (VaD) therapy. Methods: GEO datasets were analyzed to compare AIM2 inflammasome component expression in VaD patient brains versus controls. Molecular dynamics simulations identified high-affinity binding between manganese ferrocyanide and the AIM2 protein. We synthesized hollow manganese Prussian blue nanoparticles (HMPB) via biomineralization and functionalized them with M2 macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (M2exo@HMPB). Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in a VaD rat model through intravenous and intracerebroventricular administration, employing behavioral assessments, histopathological analysis, and inflammatory cytokine profiling. AIM2 inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis were investigated through protein immunoblotting, scanning electron microscopy/transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM) imaging of microglial cells, and primary microglia cultures under hypoxic-hypoglycemic conditions. Results: Gene expression analysis demonstrated significantly elevated levels of AIM2 inflammasome components in VaD patients compared to normal controls. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed effective binding of manganese ferrocyanide to AIM2. M2exo@HMPB targeted central inflamed sites and were ultimately phagocytosed by microglia. In an in vitro sustained hypoxic-hypoglycemic model, M2exo@HMPB inhibited AIM2 inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis in primary microglia, thereby reducing IL-18/IL-1β release and promoting neuronal survival. In VaD rat models, M2exo@HMPB alleviated neuronal loss and white matter lesions while improving learning and executive functions. Additionally, M2exo@HMPB demonstrated favorable in vivo biosafety. Conclusions: Integrating clinical bioinformatics with computational drug design, this study establishes a translational paradigm for nanomaterial development. M2exo@HMPB serves not only as an AIM2 inflammasome-targeting biomimetic mineralization inhibitor for VaD therapy but also provides new insights for treating AIM2-mediated cell death pathologies.

Recent advances in microbial pathogen research have highlighted the potential of gut microbe-based microbial medicine. One of the most extensively studied biological pathways is the gut-brain axis, which has been shown to reverse neurological disorders. Evidence from animal-based studies of dysbiosis suggest complex behavioral changes, such as alterations in sociability and anxiety, can be modulated through gut microbiota. Specifically, mental disorders include major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Gastrointestinal diseases can be reversed by modulating gut microbiota. Dementia and its related mechanisms are also amenable to modulation of the gut microbiota. This review focuses on the role of gut microbiota in dementia by discussing the effects on depressive symptoms, cognitive function, mood, behavioral changes, chronic stress, and the prospects of the microbiota-gut-brain axis for dementia. Although animal models have revealed promising approaches for treating dementia through the modulation of the gut microbiota, it may be premature to incorporate these interventions into standard clinical practice. The heterogeneity of findings from clinical trials and randomized control trials has yet to convincingly demonstrate the efficacy of modulation in reversing dementia and its related complications.

This case series elucidates pathological signs for diagnosis in two patients with Dementia. The first case highlights the term 'Smartphone sign', a novel psychopathology uncovered based on the existing 'TV sign', a rare type of delusional misidentification syndrome (DMS). The second case had symptoms consistent with the 'TV sign'. The possible underlying cause of these signs was hypothesized based on psychopathology, brain region, sensory system, cognition, and environmental factors. Moreover, the treatment outcome in terms of cognition and behavior on low doses of Risperidone and Escitalopram shows promising results and paves the way for the treatment of other DMS.

BACKGROUND: Actigraphy is increasingly being used to assess sleep in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. However, information on its accuracy relative to polysomnography (PSG) in this clinical population remains scarce. This study investigates the performance of actigraphy compared to PSG in patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), which is the leading form of early-onset dementia. METHODS: Eighteen patients with bvFTD (10 males, mean age 70.50 ± 8.48 years) underwent overnight, in-home PSG while concurrently wearing an actigraph on their non-dominant wrist. Actigraphy performance was assessed through discrepancy analysis, Bland-Altman plots, and epoch-by-epoch analysis (EBE). Analyses were conducted separately for the Cole-Kripke and UCSD scoring algorithms. RESULTS: Discrepancy analysis highlighted that the Cole-Kripke and UCSD algorithms overestimate total sleep time (by 43 and 60 min, respectively) and sleep efficiency (by 7.13 % and 10.33 %, respectively). The Cole-Kripke algorithm also overestimates sleep onset latency (by 7.75 min). Wake after sleep onset (WASO) showed a negative proportional bias for both algorithms, indicating that actigraphy underestimates WASO for subjects with longer PSG-measured WASO. In the EBE analysis, the Cole-Kripke algorithm shows an accuracy of 84 % (sensitivity 93 %, specificity 62 %) and the UCSD algorithm an accuracy of 85 % (sensitivity 96 %, specificity 57 %). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with bvFTD, actigraphy significantly overestimates total sleep time, sleep latency, and sleep efficiency, while underestimating WASO. Clinicians and researchers using actigraphy to study sleep in bvFTD must carefully consider these measurement biases and correct for them based on the results of previous comparison studies.

Dementia is a public health concern in the aging population with an estimated 55 million people impacted globally. Public health initiatives that focus on minimizing dementia risk factors may support efforts to reduce the incidence of dementia in at-risk populations. Exposomics considers both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for disease, including genetic changes with age and lifetime exposures to environmental, social, and behavioral risk factors. Dementia precursors may remain undetected for up to 20 years. An understanding and application of the dementia exposome may promote healthy brain interventions, screening, and risk mitigation. The proposed dementia public health exposome (DPHE) provides a framework for understanding and addressing the complex interactions between genetics, health behavior, and environment (natural, built, and social) linked to modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for dementia. The DPHE may be used to inform public health strategies and advancements in healthy brain initiatives.

Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique that is increasingly being investigated for its therapeutic potential in cognitive impairment associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. This narrative review synthesizes and critically appraises the current evidence surrounding rTMS, with particular focus on clinical efficacy, neurobiological mechanisms, and emerging innovations. High-frequency stimulation over the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) has consistently demonstrated improvements in memory, executive function, and attention, likely mediated by enhanced synaptic plasticity, increased neurotrophic factor expression, and modulation of large-scale brain networks, such as the default mode and fronto-parietal networks. Recent high-quality studies have built upon earlier research to highlight the comparative efficacy of target-specific stimulation, including precuneus- and parietal-based protocols, as well as multi- site strategies that engage language and associative regions. It also examines the use of TMSEEG and DMN connectivity as predictors of treatment response, supporting a shift toward personalized, biomarker-guided rTMS paradigms. Moreover, the synergistic potential of combining rTMS with cognitive training and pharmacotherapy is explored as a promising avenue for multimodal treatment. While preliminary results are encouraging, heterogeneity in study design and stimulation parameters continues to limit the generalizability of the findings. Standardization of protocols, longterm efficacy validation, and large-scale clinical trials remain critical to translating rTMS into routine dementia care.

Early and accurate diagnosis of dementia is essential to improving patient outcomes and reducing societal burden. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is widely used to assess cognitive function, yet traditional statistical and machine learning approaches often face limitations in capturing nonlinear interactions and subtle decline patterns. This study developed a novel deep learning-based dementia prediction model using MMSE data collected from domestic clinical settings and compared its performance with traditional machine learning models. A notable strength of this work lies in its use of item-level MMSE features combined with explainable AI (SHAP analysis), enabling both high predictive accuracy and clinical interpretability-an advancement over prior approaches that primarily relied on total scores or linear modeling. Data from 164 participants, classified into cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia groups, were analyzed. Individual MMSE items and total scores were used as input features, and the dataset was divided into training and validation sets (8:2 split). A fully connected neural network with regularization techniques was constructed and evaluated alongside Random Forest and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The deep learning model achieved the highest performance (accuracy 0.90, F1-score 0.90), surpassing Random Forest (0.86) and SVM (0.82). SHAP analysis identified Q11 (immediate memory), Q12 (calculation), and Q17 (drawing shapes) as the most influential variables, aligning with clinical diagnostic practices. These findings suggest that deep learning not only enhances predictive accuracy but also offers interpretable insights aligned with clinical reasoning, underscoring its potential utility as a reliable tool for early dementia diagnosis. However, the study is limited by the use of data from a single clinical site with a relatively small sample size, which may restrict generalizability. Future research should validate the model using larger, multi-institutional, and multimodal datasets to strengthen clinical applicability and robustness.

The field of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) urgently requires inclusive research to ensure the priorities and outcomes of research apply to those most impacted. We postulate public and participant involvement (PPI) as a pathway to achieving the best science, both in research that informs health and social policy as well as in therapeutic studies to treat and prevent ADRD. This position paper aims to provide dementia researchers with evidence to understand how to apply PPI. We begin by highlighting the disparities experienced by people with dementia, including ageism, stigma of cognitive impairment, and health disparities for minoritized communities. We then provide examples of PPI in ADRD across the research lifecycle, from defining research topics of priority to those impacted by ADRD, through the design, analysis, dissemination, and translation to policy and practice. We also provide recommendations to create and maintain collaboration between researchers and communities through PPI. HIGHLIGHTS: A central premise of public and participant involvement (PPI) is collaborative relationships between researchers and community members. To build equitable partnerships, researchers must acknowledge and understand the context of research. This includes ageism, the stigma of dementia, and ongoing discrimination for many minoritized communities. Meaningful partnerships include choice, respect, shared decision making, access, inclusion, and representation. Notably, we recommend that researchers begin partnerships early in the research process and share the impact of PPI on research.

People with cognitive impairment such as those with dementia, particularly in the moderate or advanced stages, can be excluded from qualitative interview research. However, the value of people with dementia's participation in research is increasingly acknowledged. Adaptations to qualitative interview techniques for use with people with advanced dementia are underexplored. We draw on 13 semi-structured interviews undertaken with people with advanced dementia in family and care-home settings. We examine researcher intuitive adaptations to contextualise and clarify including the importance of member checking in the moment with direct, closed questions if need be; people with dementia 'coasting' and leading; as well as carers as conversation partners. We draw out learning points around creating safe interview interactions, and strategies to enhance meaning making. We present methodological learnings and considerations when interviewing people with advanced dementia likely to be instructive for other researchers. We suggest that the research topic needs to be relatable and multiple methods of meaning making should be considered. Our analysis contributes to the growing evidence base considering how to improve meaningful engagement with people with dementia in interviewing. We encourage other researchers to reflect on their interview interactions with people with dementia to further delineate successful components and inform future research practices.

There is a need to study dementia risk factors more equitably across high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Cohort Studies of Memory in an International Consortium (COSMIC) is doing this by bringing together cohort studies of cognitive ageing from around the world to study dementia risk factors in a truly international way. COSMIC researchers have investigated a wide range of dementia risk factors across the diverse member studies and shown that some factors have different levels of association with dementia in different regions and populations. These differences include some cardiovascular and lifestyle factors having stronger associations with cognitive decline and dementia among Asian people than among White people. Conversely, more social factors were associated with reduced chances of mild cognitive impairment or dementia among Asian people than among White people. Interventions to prevent or delay dementia will require tailoring to optimise the local effect. COSMIC is currently developing methods to reliably assess dementia from limited data in under-resourced regions, producing dementia risk models appropriate for LMICs, and increasing its attention to genetics, biomarkers, and environmental factors across diverse regions and populations. Further, COSMIC is helping to train new researchers in LMICs, and COSMIC members are among the first to be boarded on Dementias Platform Australia, a secure data exchange platform facilitating cohort study data access by researchers anywhere in the world. We invite cohort studies from LMICs or under-studied populations to join COSMIC and help make dementia research as globally representative and collaborative as possible.

This review explores the origins and principles of milieu therapy, which is traditionally rooted in psychiatric settings, and examines how these concepts can be adapted for patients with dementia. While milieu therapy initially focused on long-term psychiatric inpatients, the increasing prevalence of dementia-often with complex neuropsychiatric symptoms and extended care needs-warrants a renewed look at structured therapeutic environments. Unlike psychiatric conditions that may show significant improvement with medication, dementia typically involves progressive cognitive decline and multiple comorbidities, calling for a greater emphasis on safety, predictability, and emotional support. Core principles-therapeutic environment, social interaction, consistency, shared responsibility, empowerment, and individualized interventions-can be tailored to address dementia-specific needs, including orientation aids, simplified routines, and nonverbal communication strategies. Moreover, considering that dementia predominantly affects older adults, comprehensive geriatric care becomes crucial, requiring a collaborative team approach that includes medical, psychiatric, and rehabilitative expertise. In such environments, the focus shifts from cure to maximizing well-being, dignity, self-control, and residual abilities, underscoring the relevance of milieu therapy in modern dementia care.

The progression of dementia significantly affects the abilities to communicate needs or experiences, often rendering the inner lives or narratives inaccessible to others. This increases the risk of narratives becoming 'lost' and people living with dementia becoming subject to narrative dispossession. However, even as communicative clarity diminishes, meaningful expressions persist, necessitating empathic and creative approaches to engaging with the narratives of people living with dementia.This paper outlines how the narrative agency of people living with dementia potentially diminishes as the condition progresses, making it increasingly challenging to access their personal narratives. It also explores a range of strategies for sustaining narrative expression, with particular emphasis on empathic narrative engagement-including the use of non-verbal communication, embodied interactions and interpretive practices.Emphasising the importance of engaging with the narratives of advanced dementia, the discussion frames narration as both an act of care and an ethical response to narrative silence. It advocates for imaginative engagement and highlights literature and storytelling as vital tools for understanding dementia. Autobiographical or fictional narratives by or about people with dementia offer profound insights into their experiences, fostering empathy and challenging reductive stereotypes. However, as people living with dementia approach the limits of their own narrative capacity, more speculative approaches become essential in reimagining their narratives to promote their narrative agency.To address this challenge, the paper introduces the concept of critical fabulation-a speculative yet empathic method for reimagining the narratives of advanced dementia-and argues for approaches that reconstruct lost or inaccessible narratives, bridging gaps where direct verbal communication is no longer possible.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder pathologically characterized by the presence of neuronal intracytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies. Core clinical features include fluctuating cognitive impairment, recurrent visual hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder, and Parkinsonism. Cholinergic dysfunction is implicated in many of the symptoms of DLB, based on both pathologic and functional imaging studies, as well as the clear symptomatic response of cognitive and behavioral symptoms to drugs that modulate the cholinergic system. In this chapter, we will review and discuss the evidence for cholinergic dysfunction in DLB and its clinical and therapeutic implications.

Dementia is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders in the world, and 34-63 % of individuals with dementia have psychotic symptoms. Neurobiological correlates of dementia with psychosis include significantly increased densities of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and higher D3 receptor density. Limitations of proposed diagnostic criteria include a lack of specificity for psychotic symptoms in individuals with dementia, a lack of consistent differentiation between symptoms, late recognition, and not accounting for comorbid depression or agitation that may be the primary symptom, which makes diagnosis challenging. This review aims to provide clinicians, researchers, and policymakers with a comprehensive evaluation of psychosis in dementia, covering its epidemiology, neurobiology, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. We review both psychosocial and pharmacological interventions for dementia-related psychosis. Psychosocial treatments such as meaningful communication between persons with dementia and their caregivers, simplifying the living environment, and optimizing tasks can help reduce the adverse impact of psychosis. Evidence from meta-analyses indicates modest efficacy for cholinesterase inhibitors, antidepressants, and antipsychotics for psychosis in dementia. The use of antipsychotic medications is limited by increased risks for serious adverse effects including cerebrovascular events and death. Emerging therapies such as xanomeline-trospium present promising avenues for treatment. By synthesizing current evidence and clinical guidelines, this review provides a framework for improving diagnosis and treatment of psychosis in dementia, helping clinicians and researchers refine patient care strategies while informing future research directions.

Loss of memory is the main feature of dementia, accompanied by personality changes. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia globally and a major contributor to disability and mortality in older individuals. Most notably, the neurological damage caused by AD is irreversible, but the current market still lacks effective medications for the treatment of dementia. Numerous research studies have indicated that the inflammatory response is significantly involved in the development of cognitive impairment, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in healthy people increases the likelihood of future AD. CRP is a nonspecific indicator of inflammation. In clinical practice, CRP has long been proven to be one of the risk factors and powerful predictors of neurodegenerative diseases. Given the accessibility and cost-effectiveness of CRP testing, it is reasonable to anticipate its utilisation for early screening and monitoring the progression of AD in the future. This review therefore focuses on the specific relationship between CRP and various types of dementia and explores how CRP contributes to cognitive impairment.

This study aimed to develop a novel classification model using wearable two-channel electroencephalography (EEG) data to differentiate between patients with dementia and normal controls (NCs). We employed an extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost) model combined with recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) to classify patients and NCs. The study included 54 NCs and 29 patients with dementia. Resting-state EEG was recorded, and Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) assessments were conducted. Significant differences were observed in peak frequency (PF), alpha (A), theta (T), the ratio of alpha to theta (A/T), the ratio of alpha to low-beta (A/BL), and coherence (CH) between patients and NCs. Patients with dementia exhibited decreases in PF, CH_A/T, CH_A/BL, A/T, and A/BL, while an increase in T was noted. The primary finding was that the Xgboost model, a tree ensemble classification, achieved a balanced accuracy of 97.05% with the RFECV-selected feature, which was PF. This study suggests that the novel Xgboost with RFECV classification model using two-channel EEG data could be a valuable tool for diagnosing dementia.

Alzheimer's dementia, the most common type of dementia, afflicts more than 6 million Americans. More than 80 percent of people living with dementia (PLWD) live in the community, either with caregivers or alone. As cognitive impairment becomes more severe, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) become more difficult to manage, and those with severe or dangerous BPSD may need to be treated in an inpatient psychiatric facility (IPF). The immediate goal of an IPF stay is to stabilize patients in a psychiatric crisis. IPFs primarily serve people with serious mental illness and substance use disorders, whose care needs may overlap with but also differ from the needs of PLWD. Little is known about PLWD who use IPFs. The goal of this research was to conduct exploratory analyses focused on PLWD who use IPFs to (1) characterize the population and compare them with IPF users without dementia, (2) examine characteristics and utilization patterns for different services and settings that may be associated with IPF stays, and (3) analyze outcomes following IPF stays. The authors used Medicare fee-for-service data to conduct descriptive analyses characterizing beneficiaries with dementia who experienced an IPF stay in 2018 and compare them with beneficiaries without dementia. The research team used regression analyses to explore predictors of IPF use and service use and outcomes after IPF discharge.

Research on understanding the self of persons with dementia (PWD) has increased significantly in the past decades across various fields of research. This has led to a profusion of novel conceptualizations of self. Meanwhile, the rise in dementia diagnoses worldwide presents us with complex global societal and individual challenges. Since the understanding of the self of PWD is vital for improving their well-being, autonomy and care needs, this article argues that there is a need to integrate and systematize these conceptualizations of self. The current state of conceptual unclarity undermines the wellbeing of PWD, since it impedes the exchange and development of (empirical) research results and ideas. With the aim of uniting and systematizing the conceptualizations of self in research on PWD, in order to develop a pragmatic, clustered approach based on the research of the field itself which can be applied in an empirical setting with PWD, this article departs from the literature reviews from the various fields involved in the research on the self of PWD. By focusing on the theoretical overlap between the conceptualizations of self employed in these reviews, four overarching clusters of self-aspects can be formulated: minimal, embodied-embedded, reflective and socially-embedded self-aspects. These clusters jointly provide the ground for self-continuity in PWD. This clustered approach provides a framework which unites the current field of research, within which new findings can be integrated and which can be applied in an empirical setting.

Neurodegeneration in dementia with Lewy bodies affects all crucial networks responsible for sleep control and as a result, the sleep cycle is heavily disturbed. Certain sleep syndromes such as rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and hypersomnia are particularly common and characteristic features of the disease, but patients also suffer from insomnia, sleep disordered breathing, movement disorders during sleep, or nighttime urinary dysfunction. Several treatment options are available nowadays; however, more trials on efficacy and safety in this population are still needed.

INTRODUCTION: We addressed whether higher education plays a causal role in reducing dementia risk by comparing two indices of cognitive reserve: education and young adult general cognitive ability (GCA). METHODS: We conducted a 52-year survival analysis to examine associations of GCA and education with dementia in 16,619 male conscripts identified in Swedish national health registries born between 1936 and 1958 and with available data for models including midlife occupational complexity, physical activity, and socioeconomic status (SES). RESULTS: Higher GCA was associated with lower dementia risk (hazard ratio = 0.865, 95% confidence interval = 0.756 to 0.990). After accounting for GCA, no other measure contributed significantly to dementia risk. DISCUSSION: Putative reserve effects of education or occupational complexity likely reflect largely downstream effects of prior GCA. From a lifespan perspective on reducing dementia risk, the results may suggest favoring interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive development during childhood when there is substantial brain development as opposed to later-life cognitive training. HIGHLIGHTS: Education and GCA serve as indices of cognitive reserve. Education is a modifiable risk factor that is associated with dementia risk. The effect of higher education on reduced dementia risk is not directly causal. Education is largely a downstream effect of prior level of GCA. Increasing GCA during childhood may be more effective than later cognitive training.

BACKGROUND: Evidence consistently demonstrates that lower socioeconomic status (SES) confers greater dementia risk and that it is associated with poorer outcomes including reduced access to care. Furthermore, underdiagnosis is a widespread issue in dementia. However, few studies investigate whether one of the poorer outcomes associated with lower SES is a greater degree of dementia underdiagnosis. METHODS: We conducted a province-wide repeated yearly cross-sectional study (2000-17) of community-dwelling people with incident dementia in Quebec. Data were sourced from health administrative data held at the Quebec National Institute of Public Health and SES was assessed through a material deprivation index (a composite measure of the SES of census-based neighbourhoods). Given our near population-level sample, we used a descriptive approach: we described the proportion of incident dementia cases in each of 5 SES categories, from least to most material deprivation. RESULTS: Of the 193,834 community-dwelling people with a new diagnosis of dementia between 2000-17, around 20 % belonged to each material deprivation category on average. Incident cases in the two least deprived categories comprised 18 % each of total incident cases, and 22 % each in the two most deprived categories. CONCLUSION: Despite global findings of higher dementia incidence in lower SES, we found similar incidence across levels of material deprivation. Considering that recent work indicates that lower SES in Quebec is associated with poorer health outcomes consistent with literature, our discrepant finding of comparable incidence cases in the least and most deprived neighbourhoods indicates that there is likely severe underdiagnosis of dementia in people living in more materially deprived neighbourhoods in Quebec.

There is much information available on dementia, but information may not be written at an appropriate level for a lay reader. One aim of the CoDESIGN project is to simplify information available for those who have lower levels of literacy. We investigate the potential to simplify documents to reflect the literacy abilities of the reader. We report on the ability of ChatGPT to modify documents to such target reading levels while retaining the accuracy and completeness of the documents, while avoiding the introduction of errors. Results suggest that human supervision is required before documents can be made available to readers.

BACKGROUND: The diagnostic value of midbrain atrophy for distinguishing behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) from progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether measures of midbrain atrophy differentiate PSP from bvFTD. METHODS: We included four groups: healthy controls (n = 19), PSP-Richardson syndrome (n = 20), bvFTD (n = 19) and Parkinson's disease (PD; n = 12). The following quantitative and qualitative measures were calculated: Hummingbird sign rating scale [HBS-RS], global midbrain atrophy [GMA], midbrain area, midbrain/pons ratio, the Magnetic Resonance Parkinsonism Index (MRPI), the MRPI 2.0 and brainstem volume. RESULTS: Compared to controls, PSP and bvFTD had lower values of midbrain area, HBS-RS and GMA, and higher MRPI and MRPI 2.0. HBS-RS, GMA, midbrain/pons ratio, midbrain area, MRPI, MRPI 2.0 and brainstem volume distinguished PSP from bvFTD with 73%, 67%, 75%, 83%, 71%, 69% and 82% accuracies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both quantitative and qualitative measures of midbrain atrophy provided modest accuracy in distinguishing PSP from bvFTD.

OBJECTIVE: There is growing appreciation that extracranial carotid atherosclerotic disease (ECAD) is associated with increased dementia risk. Despite this, clinical management of ECAD does not involve evaluation for cognitive outcomes or risk stratification for dementia. One impediment to studying and improving clinical care for this cohort (roughly 10% of adults aged >60 years) is that factors to identify patients with ECAD at risk for dementia are not known. METHODS: Our prospective clinicopathologic study, the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders study, evaluated clinical and histopathologic factors for dementia in subjects with ECAD. The primary outcome (dementia) was defined as a composite of Alzheimer's disease and/or vascular dementia based on a clinical/neuropathologic diagnosis. Of 1234 subjects, those with dementia other than Alzheimer's disease and/or vascular dementia were excluded; there remained 111 subjects with ECAD to be evaluated. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association of key risk factors for dementia including age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genetic status, and dementia biomarkers. A precision recall curve was also generated to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of dementia prediction models. RESULTS: Individuals with dementia compared with those without had significantly increased levels of stroke, APOE4 genotype, and dementia biomarkers, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and amyloid plaques. Models of multiple combined risk factors were little or no better than NFTs alone, which showed a 96.9% positive predictive value at an NFT threshold of 10. CONCLUSIONS: Although we hypothesized that a combination of clinical and histopathologic biomarkers would result in the strongest predictive model for dementia, we found that NFTs alone had the highest association and positive predictive value for dementia risk in patients with ECAD. As blood-based assays for NFT quantification become more clinically reliable and available, these data support the possibility that NFT quantification may help identify patients with ECAD at increased risk for dementia.

BACKGROUND: Some studies have suggested that glaucoma may be associated with neurodegeneration and a higher risk of dementia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether exposure to different categories of topical glaucoma medications is associated with differential dementia risks in people with glaucoma. METHODS: We used data from Adult Changes in Thought, a population-based, prospective cohort study that follows cognitively normal older adults from Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) until Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementia development. We included participants with a diagnosis of glaucoma, KPWA pharmacy records of filling topical glaucoma medication (alpha-adrenergic agonists [AAA], beta-adrenergic antagonists, miotics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors [CAI], and prostaglandins) and at least 10 years of pharmacy records. Eight-year sliding windows were derived for each medication class by computing days on each medication starting 10 years earlier and excluding the most recent 2 years. Cox regression used all 5 classes of medication simultaneously to predict AD and all-cause dementia. RESULTS: We included 521 participants (mean age 78 [range 65-96], 62% female) with APOE genotype data. Beta-adrenergic antagonists were the most frequently prescribed (n = 431) followed by prostaglandins (351), AAA (239), CAI (162), and miotics (142). Adjusting for time-varying exposure to other glaucoma medications, APOE, demographics, and smoking, each year of use of alpha-adrenergic agonists in an 8-year window was associated with a higher risk of developing dementia (HR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.03-1.72). CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults with treated glaucoma, exposure to alpha-adrenergic agonists appears to be associated with risk for developing all-cause dementia.

INTRODUCTION: Recently, the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) locus was proposed as influencing the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women who did not carry the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele. We examined an Amish founder population for any influence of genetic variation in and around the MGMT locus on the risk for dementia. METHODS: Genetic association was performed for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) surrounding the MGMT locus. A total of 946 individuals of Amish descent between the ages of 76 and 95 who were classified as cognitively impaired or cognitively unimpaired were included. Multiple statistical models were applied to test for replication. RESULTS: The results for the previously associated individual SNPs were not significant. However, a different SNP (rs7909468) generated significant results under a model different from the previous report. DISCUSSION: The MGMT locus may influence the risk of AD, although its genetic mechanisms remain unclear and warrant further study. HIGHLIGHTS: Association analyses around the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) locus showed a study-significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs7909468, in a female cognitively impaired group lacking the apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype. Functional implications of rs7909468 are relatively unexplored, but in silico analyses indicate it may regulate MGMT expression. rs7909468 was not in linkage disequilibrium with other SNPs found to be significant in this region and appears as a distinct novel association.

BACKGROUND: Effective and specific biomarkers are warranted for the management of vascular dementia. We aimed to systematically screen the human blood metabolome to identify potential mediators of vascular dementia via a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design. METHODS: We selected 93 unique blood metabolites from 3 metabolome genome-wide association studies (GWASs) with a total of 147,827 participants of European ancestry. Summary statistics for vascular dementia originated from a European-descent GWAS dataset released by the FinnGen Study, involving 859 cases and 211,300 controls. We applied the inverse-variance weighted MR method in the main analysis to examine the causal roles of blood metabolites in vascular dementia, followed by several sensitivity analyses for robustness validation. RESULTS: Genetically determined glycoproteins (OR per 1-SD increase, 0.75; 95 % CI, 0.68-0.83, P = 1.08 × 10(-8)) and O-methylascorbate (OR per 1-SD increase, 0.08; 95 % CI, 0.02-0.32; P = 3.74 × 10(-4)) levels had negative associations with the risk of vascular dementia, whereas genetically determined total cholesterol (OR per 1-SD increase, 1.77; 95 % CI, 1.32-2.38; P = 1.39 × 10(-4)) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (OR per 1-SD increase, 1.94; 95 % CI, 1.48-2.55; P = 1.61 × 10(-6)) levels had positive associations with the risk of vascular dementia. MR-Egger regression suggested no directional pleiotropy for the identified associations, and sensitivity analyses with different MR models further confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION: Glycoproteins, O-methylascorbate, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol might be promising blood markers of vascular dementia, which may provide novel insights into the prevention of vascular dementia. Further studies are warranted to replicate our findings and elucidate the potential mechanistic pathways.

IMPORTANCE: Dementia and urinary incontinence (UI) have been associated in cross-sectional studies. The temporal relationship between these 2 conditions is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the risk of incident dementia in female adults with and without UI using the Medicare 5% Limited Data Set. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study matched females with UI to continent controls by index year, age, and dual Medicare/Medicaid eligibility. A 2-year look back period was used to exclude prevalent dementia and neurologic disorders. The 5-year cumulative incidence of dementia was estimated for women with UI and controls. Cox proportional hazard models assessed the association of variables with dementia, adjusting for age, dual Medicare/Medicaid eligibility, race, and comorbidities. RESULTS: A total of 8,651 female beneficiaries with UI (n = 8,651) were more likely than matched controls (n = 8,651) to report White race and several medical comorbidities. The 5-year cumulative incidence of dementia diagnosis was lower in the UI versus controls (8.8% vs 10.6%, P  < 0.001). In multivariable analysis with adjustment for covariates, UI diagnosis was associated with a lower hazard of dementia diagnosis (hazard ratio 0.82 [0.74, 0.91], P  < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among female Medicare beneficiaries without baseline neurologic disorders, having any UI diagnosis was associated with a lower risk of dementia diagnosis. Further studies assessing UI symptoms and dementia diagnosis with rigorous and valid assessment tools are needed to confirm this finding.

OBJECTIVES: To review the need-driven dementia-compromised behavior (NDB) model and its application in dementia care. METHODS: This scoping review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Scoping Review guidelines. We searched electronic databases including Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and the Chinese databases CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and SinoMed from November 1996 to December 2024. RESULTS: Overall, 22 studies were included. Eleven studies explored the factors influencing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), 10 focused on nursing interventions to meet patients' needs in dementia care, and only 1 developed an assessment tool to evaluate trigger factors of BPSD. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying and assessing the background and proximal factors of patients with dementia can assist nurses and family caregivers in the early identification of patients at risk of BPSD. The NDB model-based assessment tool is used to assess possible BPSD triggers. Nursing interventions based on the NDB model positively affect BPSD and mood in people with dementia. These interventions can be tailored based on the background or target proximal factors of patients in specific settings. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Using the NDB model, caregivers can identify triggers of BPSD in patients with dementia and implement personalized intervention measures.

BackgroundDeaf individuals face barriers in accessing healthcare for dementia and Alzheimer's disease and are often overlooked in research. Deaf-friendly scales in German Sign Language (DGS) are urgently needed to ensure inclusive and equitable dementia care for Deaf individuals.ObjectiveThe aim of the study is the linguistic and cultural adaptation/validation of the Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale (DKAS-D), the Dementia Attitude Scale (DAS-D), and the Confidence in Dementia Care Scale (CODE-D) into DGS.MethodThe three scales were adapted into DGS using a collaborative translation process involving Deaf and hearing bilingual signers. A convenience sample of 205 Deaf participants answered the DKAS-DGS and DAS-DGS; a subsample answered the CODE-DGS (n = 160) online via Google Forms or as a pencil-and-paper version in person. Psychometric validation included internal consistency, structural and construct validity. For the DKAS-DGS an item analysis was conducted.ResultsInternal consistency was acceptable to good for all scales. The removal of five items from the DKAS-DGS and four from the DAS-DGS led to improvements in structural validity for both. The CODE-DGS one-factor structure showed good model fit. Construct validity was confirmed, with participants with practical or professional experience with people living with dementia scoring higher on all scales. Item analysis of the DKAS-DGS revealed challenges in translation, as well as the need for accessible, tailored dementia education for the Deaf community.ConclusionsThe three scales are valuable tools for measuring dementia knowledge, attitudes, and confidence in care among DGS-signers and may be used in future research settings.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the experiences of the carers of people living with dementia while receiving various clinical dementia services in Macao. METHODS: A qualitative approach using Van Manen's phenomenological method was adopted to explore the experiences of the carers of people living with dementia who have been receiving various clinical dementia services in Macao. Data was obtained by face-to-face interviews with 30 purposively selected participants, and then thematic analysis was used. RESULTS: Two categories related to the experiences of the carers have emerged: (1) The empathetic care as family members, consisting of themes of the caring service of doctors and nurses as warm and nuanced as family members, and the good rapport between nurses and people living with dementia; and (2) Multidisciplinary medical service team, covering themes of supporting the carers gain more knowledge, professional services of medical disciplines, and less waiting time for medical consultation. The categories capture that the carers are satisfied with the friendly attitudes and professional services of medical multidisciplines while they have been receiving various clinical dementia services in Macao. CONCLUSION: The phenomenological study can offer innovatively, a deeper understanding of the experiences of the carers of people living with dementia who have been receiving various clinical dementia services in Macao and capture the carers' satisfactions with the friendly attitudes and professional services of medical multidisciplines, and then will be utilized in designing effective initiatives to improve the practice for clinical dementia services in Macao.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to examine the status and challenges of work role support for people with early-onset dementia (EOD) in post-diagnostic support at medical centers for dementia (MCDs). METHODS: A questionnaire survey was distributed to all 499 MCD facilities to assess the practices and challenges related to work role support in post-diagnostic support for EOD. The relationship between implementation experience and challenges was analysed using the χ(2) test and logistic regression. RESULTS: Among the 129 facilities that responded (response rate: 25.9%), 64 (49.6%) provided work role support. Logistic regression analysis identified several factors associated with the challenges in work role support, including: 'As symptoms of dementia progress, it may become difficult to secure transportation to and from work', 'as symptoms of dementia progress, the patient may become unable to assume a work role, 'unstable medical condition', 'unstable motivation to work' and 'lack of awareness of the disease or acceptance of the disability'. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of the MCDs provided work role support, and facilities offering this support recognised 'progression of symptoms' and 'mental instability' as challenges. Future research should explore the underlying factors contributing to these challenges and develop strategies to address them.

The review aimed to identify and describe dementia care interventions and programs that are culturally tailored to support racial and ethnic minority informal caregivers of community-dwelling people living with dementia (PLWD) to identify gaps in need. Culturally targeted interventions to support vulnerable minority informal caregivers are important in addressing the care needs of PLWD and eliminating racial and ethnic dementia disparities. Nevertheless, little is known about the existing interventions and programs that are culturally tailored to support racial and ethnic minority groups, in particular, African-American caregivers in the care of their family members. We conducted a Scoping review, searching eight databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, APA PsycINFO, CINAHL, PUBMED, Scopus, and Web of Science between January 2012 and June 2022. Our search identified 2669 records, of which 17 articles were included in the analysis. The review addressed how these interventions have been developed to meet the needs and preferences of minority caregivers, particularly, African-American caregivers in culturally responsive ways. Findings show that culturally tailored interventions have the potential to improve the caregiving ability of informal caregivers. Supporting informal caregivers appears to be an effective strategy often improving the well-being of PLWD and reducing caregiver burden. The review demonstrates the paucity and diversity of research on culturally tailored dementia interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities. This scoping review identified gaps in the existing literature and aims for future work to develop and investigate cultural tailoring of interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Aging populations globally lead to growing challenges in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADODs). Tracking ADODs aids health strategies. To describe global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of ADODs in 2021, and analyze changes from 1990 to 2021. METHODS: We analyzed ADODs using the 2021 Global Burden of Disease database, calculating estimated annual percentage change (EAPC), applying Joinpoint regression, and assessing risk factors. RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2021, ADOD incidence, prevalence, deaths, and DALYs increased significantly. DALYs grew 295.45% and fatalities grew 167.72%. Age-standardized rates (ASRs) rose for both genders, with women generally higher but men showing steeper increases. ASRs correlated positively with Sociodemographic Index. Risk factor contribution to DALYs and death rose by 4.1%. In 2021, metabolic factors and high fasting plasma glucose most influenced ADODs. DISCUSSION: The global ADOD burden has risen since 1990. Early screening, especially for elderly women, is crucial. Policymakers must act to reverse this trend. HIGHLIGHTS: Based on Global Burden of Disease data 1990-2021, the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years due to Alzheimer's and dementia are depicted globally, regionally, and nationally.The effects of gender and age were explored.The contribution of different risk factors to the disease was studied.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review is to map the existing evidence on the epidemiology, care challenges, and impacts of various wound types among individuals living with dementia across different stages of the disease. INTRODUCTION: Dementia is a growing global health concern, projected to rise significantly as the population ages. This condition not only affects cognitive function but also increases the risk of chronic wounds in part due to impairments in mobility, self-care, and communication. Current wound care guidelines inadequately address the specific needs of individuals with dementia. This scoping review seeks to fill this gap by comprehensively exploring the intersection between dementia and wound care. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review will include studies involving adults aged 18 and older diagnosed with dementia or cognitive impairment who are experiencing alterations in skin integrity, such as pressure injuries, venous and arterial ulcers, and diabetic ulcers. Both qualitative and quantitative studies will be considered, as well as studies focusing on the challenges faced by caregivers in managing wounds in this population. Excluded are studies such as editorials and opinion articles. METHODS: A comprehensive search strategy will be employed across multiple electronic databases, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and PubMed, as well as grey literature sources like ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global and OpenGrey. The search will include studies published in English and French without date restrictions. Data will be extracted using a pilot-tested tool and presented in graphical, diagrammatic, and tabular formats. A narrative summary will accompany these visuals, providing context and insights into the data in relation to the review's objectives.

BACKGROUND: With an increased aging population, the number of individuals with dementia is expected to rise. The onset of dementia marks the start of negotiating access to a wide range of health and social services to find practical and emotional supports to deal with the management of changes and subsequent challenges that individual with dementia face. The toll of dementia goes beyond the health care system, affecting families and caregivers' quality of life. This places more pressure on family caregivers and health care institutions to provide services for affected individuals. It is important to understand the service needs of this population to enable them to live at home longer, contribute to society and maintain a positive quality of life. AIM: To increase understanding of how persons living at home with early dementia and their caregivers/significant others currently perceive and interact with health and community-based services and service providers. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive approach was used to explore the experiences of individuals with early dementia and care providers with health and community-based services using semi-structured interviews and content analysis. RESULTS: Participants included 16 individuals 50 years and older with mild/early dementia living at home, 22 informal caregivers of individuals with mild/early dementia, and 5 key community informants (community health nurses and social workers). Four thematic categories of barriers and two thematic categories of facilitators for access to and uptake of supportive services were identified. Five strategies to inform the development of an action plan to enhance access to, and uptake of, supportive services were determined. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition of dementia through education and publicity enhanced public awareness, attention, and social inclusion with dementia-friendly neighborhoods and facilities need to be considered to achieve effective dementia-related services. Inclusion and recognition of the wishes of persons with dementia is key.

PURPOSE: Prenatal factors such as maternal stress, infection and nutrition affect fetal brain development and may also influence later risk for dementia. The purpose of this systematic review was to provide an overview of all studies which investigated the association between prenatal factors and later risk for dementia. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE and Embase for original human studies reporting on associations between prenatal factors and dementia from inception to 23 November 2022. Prenatal factors could be any factor assessed during pregnancy, at birth or postnatally, provided they were indicative of a prenatal exposure. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. We followed PRISMA guidelines for reporting. RESULTS: A total of 68 studies met eligibility criteria (including millions of individuals), assessing maternal age (N = 30), paternal age (N = 22), birth order (N = 15), season of birth (N = 16), place of birth (N = 13), prenatal influenza pandemic (N = 1) or Chinese famine exposure (N = 1), birth characteristics (N = 3) and prenatal hormone exposure (N = 4). We observed consistent results for birth in a generally less optimal environment (e.g. high infant mortality area) being associated with higher dementia risk. Lower and higher birth weight and prenatal famine exposure were associated with higher dementia risk. The studies on season of birth, digit ratio, prenatal influenza pandemic exposure, parental age and birth order showed inconsistent results and were hampered by relatively high risk of bias. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that some prenatal factors, especially those related to a suboptimal prenatal environment, are associated with an increased dementia risk. As these associations may be confounded by factors such as parental socioeconomic status, more research is needed to examine the potential causal role of the prenatal environment in dementia.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) Guiding an Improved Dementia Experience (GUIDE) Model represents a landmark opportunity to improve outcomes for persons with dementia and their caregivers and scale comprehensive dementia care through a structured service delivery and alternative payment approach. The National Dementia Care Collaborative (NDCC), a coalition of scientific and clinical leaders in evidence-based dementia care, works to promote comprehensive dementia care. Drawing from the experiences of six previously tested programs-Aging Brain Care, Alzheimer's and Dementia Care, BRI Care Consultation, Care Ecosystem, Integrated Memory Care, and MIND at Home-we describe a four-step approach to enable successful adoption and implementation: identifying key leaders and partners, preparing a tailored value proposition, initiating program start-up, and ensuring sustainable implementation. Our guidance also emphasizes leveraging existing community assets, aligning efforts with organizational priorities, and using both storytelling and data to make the case for change. We highlight practical tools and resources to address operational challenges, including electronic health record integration, reimbursement strategies, and staff training. By focusing on evidence-based models, health systems and other providers can accelerate implementation, reduce costly emergency and institutional care, and deliver high-quality, person-centered support. This approach can help to empower GUIDE participants and others to build effective, durable, scalable comprehensive dementia care systems, ultimately advancing the goal of establishing such care as a permanent Medicare benefit.

INTRODUCTION: Digital technologies are increasingly used in the delivery of health and social care, and by the public, to foster a decentralised approach to healthcare provision and encourage self-management. If new technologies and related innovations are to support people with dementia, it is important to understand the views and needs of people with dementia alongside those of their carers, but this is an under-researched area. This study focuses on how smartphones are used by people with dementia and their carers. OBJECTIVES: To undertake a national survey of people with dementia and their carers to explore their experiences and opinions relating to the use of smartphones by people with dementia. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional survey (12 questions) with participants recruited via two UK-based dementia research registries. Descriptive and inferential statistics assessed smartphone ownership, usage patterns, and challenges. RESULTS: There were 719 respondents (276 people with dementia, 443 carers). Amongst smartphone owners (47.7 %), only 39.4 % used these devices for dementia management: 89 people with dementia and 19 carers (reporting for people with dementia), mainly for memory support. Overall, 52.8 % used smartphones for safety and independence, primarily specifically for communication (128 people with dementia, 44 carers). Key barriers included setup difficulty (people with dementia) and complexity concerns (non-owners), with moderate concerns over fraud and theft. CONCLUSION: Smartphones are underused in dementia care. Improving usability, nuanced smartphone functionality (and app co-design), and enhancing accessibility are essential to reducing digital exclusion and improving care engagement.

Does the pursuit of disability justice for people with dementia require that people with dementia personally identify as disabled? On one level, self-representation has been a critical strategy for combating harmful and inaccurate assumptions that people with disabilities or dementia are inherently incapable of self-advocacy. At the same time, disability-rights narratives in which self-representation is fundamental to liberation cannot fully account for the realities of people with advanced dementia or other conditions that profoundly affect cognitive function. This essay argues that bringing disability and dementia advocacy together requires a shift beyond identity-based personal narratives and toward structural narratives that illustrate the processes through which dementia is historically constructed and that imagine alternatives to those processes. Such narratives not only reveal the effects of ableism beyond those who identify as disabled but also illuminate possibilities for resisting harmful structural forces through coalitional organizing and solidarity.

This essay provides a critical overview of historical and contemporary conceptualisations of selfhood in dementia. We explore the intersections of psychological and sociological research, as well as care practices, in dementia scholarship and how these have evolved in the years leading to and proceeding the start of the twenty-first century. Focusing on historical discourses of dementia and the metaphor of dementia as a 'living death', this essay maps the development of prominent conceptualisations of dementia in western cultures, from their roots in Cartesian philosophy to modernist values and existential anxieties. We firstly explore historical notions of selfhood in people living with dementia and the presumed erosion of the self that culminates in a so-called living death. Then, we discuss the radical shift in attitudes that arose around the start of the twenty-first century towards perseverance of selfhood in dementia and person-centred care. We finally consider whether our current understanding of selfhood in dementia could benefit from a posthuman approach, which requires a radical shift towards a more relational, multiple, and ultimately affirmative ways of caring for dementia.

INTRODUCTION: This review aimed to systematically assess the literature reporting the relationship between dementia and standard automated perimetry results, including sensitivity, global indices, patterns of visual field defect and reliability indices. DESIGN: A scoping review and meta-analysis were conducted. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Published studies in any setting which reported on standard automated perimetry results (any of: global indices, pointwise sensitivities, reliability indices and/or patterns of visual field defects) in participants with ('cases') or without ('controls') dementia due to neurodegenerative disease. METHODS: Four databases were searched (to July 2024) and included published studies comparing the perimetry results of cases and controls. Standardised mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated where data were available. Studies with qualitative visual field results were identified and described. The Joanna Briggs Institute checklists were used for quality assessment. RESULTS: Four studies were included in the meta-analysis component of the study. Standardised mean differences between cases and controls were -1.16 (-1.47, -0.86) and -0.96 (-1.26, -0.67) for mean deviation and pattern standard deviation, respectively. The standardised mean differences for fixation loss, false positive and false negative rates were -0.30 (-0.57, -0.04), -0.33 (-0.60, -0.06) and -1.12 (-1.40, -0.83), respectively. In all instances, cases had poorer results than controls. Hemianopias were the most common visual field defect pattern, followed by quadrantonopia, with left-sided defects more common than right. Several studies illustrated visual field sensitivity and deviation maps, from which examples of inattentive defects were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Cross-sectional studies, case series and case reports demonstrated worse visual function and reliability indices in patients with dementia in comparison to controls. Several knowledge gaps and opportunities for further study were identified, including potentially using patterns of poor test reliability and inattention as surrogate markers of cognitive impairment and its relationship with quantitative evaluation of cognitive function.

Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative condition, primarily caused by Alzheimer's disease, predominantly affecting elderly individuals. Under these circumstances, dementia care focuses on assisting patients with daily living, either in nursing facilities or at home. The condition imposes substantial economic burdens on patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems, particularly in Europe and North America, where precise cost assessments are essential. This review examines the economic impact of dementia care by integrating diverse cost estimation sources to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of preventive care for high-risk individuals and providing meta-analytic estimates of annual medical, non-medical, and informal care costs per patient, and compares these costs with care effectiveness. The analysis focuses on Europe and the United States, with a greater emphasis on Europe, aiming to encourage further research on preventive strategies and caregiver support. Dementia presents a significant economic challenge globally, driven by rising healthcare costs and an aging population. The disparities between direct and indirect costs in the US and Europe highlight the impact of healthcare systems and cultural practices on dementia care costs. Preventive measures could significantly reduce long-term treatment costs, making them a crucial investment to alleviate future financial burdens.

Bereaved dementia caregivers face unique challenges in navigating grief, yet research on dementia-specific adaptive grieving remains limited. Expanding on a prior scoping review, this concept analysis clarifies the theoretical construct of adaptive grief among bereaved dementia caregivers using Rodgers' evolutionary approach, which views concepts as dynamic and evolving. A review of 11 data sources (2013-2024) across nursing, sociology, medicine, and psychology identified three key attributes of dementia-specific adaptive grief: (1) rebuilding purpose: reconnecting with interests and community on one's own terms, (2) integrating change: blending past, present, and future experiences to regain direction, and (3) growing toward potential: pursuing self-defined goals and personal development. By defining dementia-specific adaptive grief, this concept analysis provides healthcare professionals with a clearer framework to recognize its evolving nature and distinguish it from maladaptive grief. It also emphasizes the need for longitudinal and culturally diverse research to inform tailored interventions that better support bereaved dementia caregivers.

PURPOSE: To analyze swallowing in older adults with dementia through clinical evaluation at a referral center for elderly healthcare. METHODS: Retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study with older people, stratified by the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Characterization was based on data extracted from medical records, including functional, cognitive, and mood assessments. The clinical evaluation of swallowing consisted of food offered in three consistencies, analyzing 13 items and functional classification. RESULTS: The sample included 149 older adults - 47 neurotypical (CDR 0), 37 with mild dementia (CDR 1), 40 with moderate dementia (CDR 2), and 25 with severe dementia (CDR 3). The groups differed significantly, indicating greater changes in swallowing according to the severity of dementia. For instance, CDR 3 had greater changes in oral spillage of liquids than CDR 0 (p=0.012*). Cough with solids and drop in oxygen saturation with liquids were greater in CDR 3 than in CDR 1 (p=0.039* and p=0.047*, respectively). CDR 3 also had a higher frequency of reduced laryngeal excursion with nectar than CDR 2 (p=0.044*). Only positive cervical auscultation with nectar showed greater change in CDR 2 than in CDR 1 (p=0.019*). Oral residue of solids had a greater change in CDR 1 than in CDR 0 (p=0.030*). CONCLUSION: The severity of dementia was associated with swallowing impairments, highlighting the need for specific interventions in this population.

Social isolation is reported to be a risk factor for dementia. In addition to loneliness, it is related to other dementia risk factors, such as hearing and visual loss, and depression. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic exacerbated social isolation and loneliness. Recent studies on social isolation and loneliness have reported their neuropathological and basic medical effects on brain function and gene expression. This overview describes the influences of social isolation and loneliness on dementia and its prevention.

The moral authority of advance directives (ADs) in the context of persons living with dementia (PLWD) has sparked a multifaceted debate, encompassing concerns such as authenticity and the appropriate involvement of caregivers. Dresser critiques ADs based on Parfit's account of numeric personal identity, using the often-discussed case of a PLWD called Margo. She claims that dementia leads to a new manifestation of Margo emerging, which then contracts pneumonia. Dworkin proposes that critical interests, concerning one's higher moral values, trump experiential interests (things or activities one enjoys because they are pleasurable). Dresser argues that Margo's current experiential interests override her self's critical ones, as they contribute significantly to her quality of life (QoL). To render the argument more realistic, I introduce a variation in which Margo develops delirium, a common and severe comorbidity in PLWD. I argue that delirium could precipitate a sudden decline in experiential interests and, consequently, a deterioration in QoL. Given the uncertain trajectory of Margo's illness, I contend that her competent self's critical interests, as reflected in her AD, along with her right to self-ownership, should take precedence over current experiential interests. Thus, the AD possesses moral authority. However, it is imperative for healthcare professionals to offer consultations for PLWD, facilitating an understanding of ADs and enabling a shared decision-making process. Such consultations are essential for honouring the autonomy and dignity of PLWD, ensuring that their values and preferences guide ethical decision-making amidst the complexities of dementia care.

BACKGROUND: Dementia, a rapidly growing cognitive disorder, has a profound impact on the lives of individuals and their caregivers across the globe. Digital life storybooks have emerged as a promising non-pharmacological intervention to improve the wellbeing of people living with dementia (PLWD). OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the feasibility of developing and applying a digital life storybook for PLWD using telehealth, while evaluating its impact on communication skills, quality of life (QoL) and satisfaction levels. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A mixed-method study design will be employed, involving pairs of PLWD and their primary caregivers (dyads) recruited from a teaching hospital and a non-profit organization in Malaysia. The intervention involves the creation and use of a digital life storybook facilitated remotely via telehealth channels. Data will be collected at 6 points in time: prior to the commencement of development, prior to the submission of an application, on a biweekly basis, and at the conclusion of the assessment period. Quantitative measures will include the Holden Communication Scale, Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QoL-AD) and Quality of the Caregiving Relationship (QCPR) questionnaire. Qualitative data will be gathered through validated open-ended questions. RESULTS: Implications of the study include facilitating future research, contributing to person-centered care practices, and providing caregivers with tools to better understand and connect with PLWD. The findings will contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms through which digital life storybooks can benefit PLWD and their caregivers. CONCLUSION: The successful implementation of this protocol could have significant implications for dementia care in both formal and informal settings, and could ultimately improve the lives of those affected by dementia.

IMPORTANCE: An accessible marker of both biological age and dementia risk is crucial to advancing dementia prevention and treatment strategies. Although frailty is a candidate for that role, the nature of the relationship between frailty and dementia is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the temporal relationship between frailty and incident dementia by investigating frailty trajectories in the years preceding dementia onset. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participant data came from 4 prospective cohort studies: the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, the Health and Retirement Study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project, and the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center. Data were collected between 1997 and 2024 and were analyzed from July 2023 to August 2024. The settings were retirement communities, national-level surveys, and a multiclinic-based cohort. Included individuals were 60 years or older and without cognitive impairment at baseline. Included individuals also had data on age, sex, education level, and ethnicity and a frailty index score calculated at baseline. EXPOSURE: Frailty was the main exposure, with participants' degrees of frailty quantified using retrospectively calculated frailty index scores. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident all-cause dementia ascertained through physician-derived diagnoses, self- and informant-report, and estimated classifications based on combinations of cognitive tests. RESULTS: The participant number before exclusions was 87 737. After exclusions, data from 29 849 participants (mean [SD] age, 71.6 [7.7] years; 18 369 female [62%]; 257 963 person-years of follow-up; 3154 cases of incident dementia) were analyzed. Bayesian generalized linear mixed regression models revealed accelerations in frailty trajectories 4 to 9 years before incident dementia. Overall, frailty was positively associated with dementia risk (adjusted hazard ratios [aHRs] ranged from 1.18; 95% CI, 1.13-1.24 to 1.73; 95% CI, 1.57-1.92). This association held among participants whose time between frailty measurement and incident dementia exceeded the identified acceleration period (aHRs ranged from 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12-1.23 to 1.43; 95% CI, 1.14-1.80). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that frailty measurements may be used to identify high-risk population groups for preferential enrolment into clinical trials for dementia prevention and treatment. Frailty itself may represent a useful upstream target for behavioral and societal approaches to dementia prevention.

BACKGROUND: Caregiver burden in Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) is greater than in other forms of dementia. Most of the research has focused on spouses' burden but the impact on offspring has not been investigated to date, even though FTD is often a presenile dementia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the burden of offspring caregivers (OC) of patients with FTD. METHODS: A total of 55 OC of patients with FTD were included and interviewed. OC burden was assessed by Burden Assessment Scale (BAS). Predictors of OC burden were assessed, considering a) OC demographic features, and b) primary caregiver (PC) (i.e., spouses) demographic features and burden, and c) FTD patient' related-features. RESULTS: OC sex was the only significant predictor of BAS scores (p = 0.011), with females offspring reporting higher burden compared to males. Females OC of more educated PC perceive greater burden (p = 0.004), while younger age in males OC was associated with greater burden (p =0.016). In cohabitants, OC burden was significantly associated with PC burden (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that supportive programs should be developed not only for PC but also for OC of patients with FTD, especially in females and in cohabitants OC.

BACKGROUND: Engagement in cognitive leisure activities (CLA) may reduce the risk of dementia, but findings are often challenged by reverse causation and unmeasured cognitive reserve. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between CLA and incident dementia whilst accounting for reverse causation and lifelong cognitive enrichment. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with a 12-year follow-up, including a 7-year exposure-outcome time lag. SETTING: Community-dwelling older adults from the three-city study conducted in France. SUBJECTS: A total of 3326 participants aged 65 and older, free of dementia at baseline and during the time-lag period. METHODS: At baseline, participants reported frequency of engagement in five cognitively stimulating activities. A global CLA score was calculated and categorised into low, moderate, and high engagement. Incident dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) were ascertained during the 5-year follow-up. Delayed-entry Cox models with age as the time scale were used, adjusting for socio-demographic, health-related, and genetic factors including APOE ε4 and past occupational grade. RESULTS: Compared to low CLA engagement, moderate and high engagement were associated with lower risk of dementia (hazard ratios [HR] = 0.50 [95% CI: 0.33-0.76] and 0.53 [0.35-0.80]) and AD (HR = 0.35 [0.20-0.59] and 0.45 [0.28-0.73]). Frequent engagement in crosswords and artistic activities showed the strongest independent associations with reduced dementia risk. CONCLUSIONS: CLA in late life is associated with lower dementia risk, beyond the influence of cognitive reserve and reverse causation. Promoting such activities may be a valuable component of dementia prevention strategies in older adults.

INTRODUCTION: This paper quantifies how incident dementia diagnosis rates vary for similar beneficiaries in traditional Medicare (TM) and Medicare Advantage (MA) seen by the same primary care provider (PCP). METHODS: This cohort analysis used 2016 to 2018 data for Medicare beneficiaries. Using a propensity score-matched sample of beneficiaries with similar likelihood of MA enrollment, we estimated linear probability models with PCP fixed effects of incident dementia diagnosis in 2017 for beneficiaries in MA relative to beneficiaries in TM. RESULTS: Among a matched sample of 15,410,030 beneficiaries, accounting for both provider and patient characteristics, the incident dementia diagnosis rate was 0.11 percentage points lower for MA beneficiaries compared to TM beneficiaries attributed to the same PCP. MA patients were less likely to be seen by dementia specialists. DISCUSSION: Differences in system-level factors such as access to dementia specialists is a contributing factor to differences in diagnosis rates in MA and TM. HIGHLIGHTS: In this study, we quantify how incident dementia diagnosis rates vary for similar beneficiaries in TM and MA seen by the same PCP. To investigate the role of insurance design on dementia diagnosis, we examined differences in diagnosis rates for TM and MA beneficiaries seen by the same PCP. Among a matched sample of TM and MA beneficiaries with assigned PCPs in 2017, incident dementia diagnosis rates were 0.11 percentage points lower for MA beneficiaries compared to TM beneficiaries seen by the same PCP. MA patients were less likely to be seen by dementia specialists compared to TM beneficiaries seen by the same PCP.

INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are prevalent in clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet their etiology remains unclear. We assessed associations between NPS and neuropathologic features in dementia patients. METHODS: Logistic regression analyses estimated associations between neuropathologic lesions and retroactively assigned NPS phenotypes (early and late psychosis [EPS, LPS], early and late affective symptoms [EAS, LAS]). RESULTS: EPS was associated with Lewy body (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4, p < 0.0001) and white matter (OR = 1.7, p < 0.0001) pathology. LPS was associated with moderate/severe neurofibrillary tangles (OR = 2.8, p < 0.0001), moderate/frequent neuritic plaques (OR = 2.3, p < 0.0001), Lewy bodies (OR = 1.9, p < 0.0001), and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (OR = 1.6, p < 0.0001). EAS was associated with white matter injury (OR = 3.4, p < 0.0001); EAS and LAS were associated with moderate/severe neurofibrillary tangles (ORs = 1.7, 1.9, p < 0.005). Risk for EPS, LPS, and EAS increased with total neuropathologic burden. DISCUSSION: NPS subtypes are differentially associated with AD/non-AD neuropathologic features, suggesting that efficiency of interventional targets may depend upon timing and type of NPS. HIGHLIGHTS: Timing/nature of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) had distinct associations with brain autopsy findings in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Increased odds for psychosis symptoms was associated with both Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). Late psychosis symptoms (PS) was most strongly associated with ADNC, early PS most strongly with LBD. Early PS and affective symptoms were both associated with white matter disease.

INTRODUCTION: Identifying dementia neuropathology is critical for guiding effective therapies and clinical trials. To tackle this, we developed semi-supervised models for identifying neuropathology using low-burden data to improve generalizability. METHODS: We defined low-burden data as being reasonably obtainable at a primary care setting. By using a semi-supervised learning paradigm, we can amplify the utility of low-burden data. We trained a clustering and a semi-supervised prediction model to yield clustering and prediction results for different neuropathology lesion types. RESULTS: Our clustering model identified two clinically meaningful outlier groups that were either neuropathology-enriched or -scarce. We predicted neuropathology burden across different pathology types and found that using low-burden data over multiple clinical visits can predict neuropathology on par with using higher-burden data. DISCUSSION: This work fills a critical gap in the field by using low-burden clinical data to predict neuropathology, thereby improving dementia screening, therapy, and targeted clinical trials. HIGHLIGHTS: Clinical data are useful for neuropathology screening in future clinical trials. Novel application of semi-supervised learning for identifying neuropathology. Clustering model found groups with highly different neuropathology prevalence. Low-burden data can provide relatively accurate predictions of pathology load. Higher-burden, longitudinal data are most helpful for predicting vascular lesions.

Dementia is responsible for untold suffering, most significant is the fear that someone will lose themselves. This fear raises very serious pastoral questions: Who is the person living with dementia? Are they the same person they have always been or someone new? In either case, how do we treat them? Using the well-known case of Margo and the discussions between Dworkin and Dresser around advanced care directives, this article radically challenges the standard psychology view of personhood as being pastorally unhelpful in dementia cases. We argue that a relational view of personhood is not only epistemologically consistent but better suited to the pastoral challenge presented by dementia than that of the standard psychological view. While dementia represents the loss of cognitive abilities, and in many cases an entire change in personality, it does not represent either the loss of a person nor a change of personhood. Through dementia a person remains a person because they are personally related to by the same community of persons who have always loved them. This normative framework offers those living with dementia, their community, and their carers with a coherent, yet pastorally helpful response to the existential questions raised by dementia.

INTRODUCTION: Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is challenging due to overlapping symptoms with other dementias and the invasiveness of current biomarkers. This study introduces the NULISA platform, a novel proteomics technology, to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of known biomarkers and uncover novel biomarkers underlying different dementias. METHODS: We analyzed plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 248 participants diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Plasma biomarkers were evaluated using regression models, receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) analysis, and pathway enrichment. RESULTS: Plasma phosphorylated Tau217 (pTau217) demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for AD, DLB, and FTD (area under the curve [AUCs]: 0.9, 0.84, and 0.79, respectively). CXCL1 (fractalkine), synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1), β-synuclein, and tyrosine kinase (TEK) are expressed differently in DLB and FTD than AD. Ingenuity pathway analyses revealed astrocytic, synaptic, and inflammatory pathways as shared and distinct mechanisms across these dementia types. CONCLUSION: Our findings establish plasma pTau217 as a robust diagnostic marker. This study provides new plasma biomarkers for differential diagnosis of dementias with a noninvasive method. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma pTau217 showed high diagnostic accuracy for AD, DLB, and FTD. CXCL1, SNAP25, TREM1, β-synuclein, and TEK are novel markers distinguishing other dementias from AD. Noninvasive plasma biomarkers enable diagnosis and differentiation of dementias.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is characterized by a wide variety of symptoms, of which the combinations and order of appearance vary widely between patients. The primary target symptoms for treatment must be identified for each patient to establish a treatment plan. In this article, from a psychiatrist's perspective, I have summarized the symptoms that are targets of treatment, along with the severity of dementia and the key collaboration points between psychiatry and neurology. Attending physicians have experienced difficulties understanding the main treatment needs of their patients and caregivers, despite their expertise in DLB, because of the various clinical manifestations. It is therefore important for clinicians to pay attention to the need to treat psychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairment, Parkinsonism, sleep-related disorders, autonomic dysfunction, and abnormal eating behaviors.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between duration of benzodiazepine exposure and the risk of dementia. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study using administrative health data followed 3 age-based strata (ages 55, 65 and 75) for up to a maximum of 22 years to examine risk of dementia due to benzodiazepine use. Each stratum was analyzed as a whole, then restricted to persons with depression or anxiety, and finally using high dimension propensity scores (HDPS) matched cohort. SETTING: We used administrative data on subjects receiving standard medical care in Manitoba, Canada. MEASUREMENTS: Prescription data was used to quantify benzodiazepine using cumulative defined-daily-dose (DDD). Comorbidities and cases of dementia were determined using medical and hospital data. RESULTS: Dementia risk in high-dose users of the youngest strata was elevated compared to non-users (adjusted HR (aHR) 1.33; 95 % CI 1.05-1.68)). Little to no difference was found in the middle (aHR 1.17; 1.02-1.33) and oldest strata (aHR 1.02; 0.93-1.11). Restriction to persons with depression or anxiety eliminated the association. No association was found using HDPS-matched comparison groups. CONCLUSIONS: Only a modest increase in dementia risk was seen in the high-dose benzodiazepine users. This association appears to be driven by the confounding due to higher rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and anxiety among users. Using restriction or HDPS to better control for confounding effects eliminates the association. While benzodiazepines do not appear to be a significant risk factor for dementia, tolerance, dependency and adverse effects caution against their long-term use.

Dementia blood biomarkers are becoming increasingly important. Various factors, such as ischemic lesions and inflammation, can influence the pathomechanism of dementia. We aimed to evaluate the effects of past stroke lesions on blood biomarkers (BMs). Following approval from the institutional ethics committee, patients who were admitted to the memory clinic and were consented to written documents were enrolled (n = 111, average [standard deviation] age: 74.5 [9.1] years-old). Brain magnetic resonance imaging, cognitive function, and neuropsychological symptoms were analyzed. The amyloid-β 42 (Aβ42)/Aβ40 ratio, phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and Aβ42/p-tau181 ratio were assessed as plasma BMs. The patients were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (n = 45), mild cognitive impairment (n = 56), depression (n = 8), and subjective cognitive impairment (n = 4). Bivariate analysis exhibited that all measured BM indicators were significantly associated with cognitive decline in patients without past stroke lesions. Whereas the patients with stroke lesions presented a significant association only between GFAP and cognitive decline (p = 0.0011). Multiple regression analysis showed that NfL significantly correlated with cognitive decline only in patients without stroke lesions (r = 0.4988, p = 0.0003) and with delusion only in those with stroke lesions (r = 0.5492, p = 0.0121). Past stroke lesions should be addressed in the assessment of the correlation between blood biomarkers and cognitive decline in dementia patients.

INTRODUCTION: This study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and validity of EQ-5D instrument administration methods and proxy selection for evaluating health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in dementia populations. EQ-5D is a widely used measure of HRQoL and is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for cost-effectiveness analyses of health interventions. METHODS: Individual-level data from three trials were analyzed separately to evaluate missing data rates, inter-rater agreement, responsiveness, and predictors of EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L) dimensions and index values. The study used psychometric analyses, correlations, and multivariate linear regression models to evaluate EQ-5D dimension reports. Reports from both people with dementia (PwD) and proxies were compared to assess reliability across different settings and proxy types. RESULTS: Proxy-reported EQ-5D achieved higher completion rates compared to reports from PwD, with proxies showing greater responsiveness to changes in symptom scores over time. Face-to-face instrument administration for informal proxies was favored over postal methods, and proxy selection was found to be crucial, with informal proxies recommended for community-dwelling PwD and staff proxies for institutionalized populations. Inter-rater agreement was strongest for the "mobility" dimension, with differences in reporting by dimension. Novel guidelines on integrating EQ-5D data reported by PwD and proxies are proposed. Combining self- and proxy-reported data to generate an integrated utility score potentially reflects a more holistic perspective and may enhance the accuracy of HRQoL assessment, compared to relying solely on one respondent's reports. DISCUSSION: The importance of careful administration and proxy selection for HRQoL data collection and application in dementia trials and studies is highlighted. These findings have implications for informing economic evaluations of dementia interventions, emphasizing the potential need for tailoring approaches to HRQoL assessment based on the residential status of the PwD. HIGHLIGHTS: The EQ-5D is a widely used measure in dementia trials, but challenges like missing data and discrepancies in inter-rater agreement highlight complexities in assessing health-related quality of life (HRQoL), especially in advanced stages.This study empirically examines the feasibility, acceptability, and validity of EQ-5D data from people with dementia and proxies, using individual-level data from three trials.Recommendations are provided to improve data collection practices, enhancing the reliability of HRQoL assessments in clinical trials for dementia interventions.Optimized proxy selection criteria and administration methods tailored to residential status can improve HRQoL assessments, supporting more accurate economic evaluations and better-informed care decisions.

BACKGROUND: Dementia and disability are highly prevalent after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Previous studies categorizing ICH by large anatomic boundaries have demonstrated that lobar ICH is associated with dementia, while ICH in the basal ganglia is associated with disability. This study aims to refine our understanding of the association between ICH location and post-ICH dementia and disability at a voxel level, which could improve the prognostic accuracy of these outcomes and provide mechanistic insights into post-ICH functional outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this cohort study, we segmented the ICH lesions from the noncontrast computed tomography scans from 882 patients from the MGH-ICH (Massachusetts General Hospital ICH Study) as the discovery data set and from 146 patients from the Yale-ICH cohort as the validation data set. Using electronic health records and follow-up telephone interviews, incident dementia (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] codes of dementia or modified telephone interview for cognitive status <20) and disability (modified Rankin Scale score >2) were identified. The median follow-up times of the MGH-ICH and Yale-ICH cohorts were 2.9 (interquartile range, 1.0-5.8) years and 1.0 (interquartile range, 0.6-1.0) years, respectively. Two techniques of lesion symptom mapping were applied on the ICH lesions: sparse canonical correlation analysis for neuroimaging and voxel-based lesion symptom mappings. Dementia conversion after ICH was associated with ICH in the left temporo-occipital region (mean hazard ratio [HR], 3.62 [95% CI, 2.71-4.63]) and left superior longitudinal fasciculus (mean HR, 2.91 [95% CI, 2.40-3.52]). Development of disability after ICH was linked to the right cerebral peduncle (mean HR, 3.10 [95% CI, 2.44-3.94]), right pallidum (mean HR, 2.96 [95% CI, 1.99-4.25]), and right posterior limb of the internal capsule (mean HR, 2.54 [95% CI, 1.88-3.96]). CONCLUSIONS: Specific distribution of ICH lesions is linked to development of dementia and disability after ICH. These insights have the potential to enhance clinical prognostic models for patients with ICH, facilitating more precise predictions of outcomes based on hemorrhage location.

Neurocognitive deficits are the presenting complaint in 4% to 15% of patients diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Patients may present with nonspecific complaints such as deficits in memory, concentration, attention, and motor skills. These symptoms are common in many disorders, and accurate diagnosis is critical for appropriate treatment. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex (ADC) was first defined in 1986. This was a frequent feature of HIV disease before antiretroviral therapy (ART) and highly active antiretroviral therapy came into common use in the mid-1990s. In addition to medical comorbidities, patients also frequently have various mental or psychosocial issues that can affect cognitive function, including mood disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse or dependence. Increased risk of opportunistic infections, tumors, and side effects of ART drugs may also contribute to neurologic effects. Patients can experience delirium as part of the acute HIV syndrome or develop dementia during the later stages of their disease. The spectrum of progressively more severe neurologic and cognitive symptoms (previously known as ADC) are now referred to as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) and were categorized in 2007 by the United States National Institutes of Health to include 3 classifications. These range in severity from asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment to minor neurocognitive disorder and HIV-associated dementia (HAD). The distinction between these levels is made by the use of neuropsychological testing in addition to observation of symptomatic functional impairment. Any other condition, including infection, cerebrovascular disease, or toxic encephalopathy, must not explain the observed impairment. In practice, distinguishing between the less severe categories of disease in the acute care setting is difficult due to the necessity of neuropsychological testing. Due to the profound symptomology and functional deficits associated with HAD, this diagnosis may be presumed, especially in patients with untreated or advanced stages of AIDS disease.

Despite elevated risk profiles for dementia, Black women are often absent in cultural narratives about dementia. This paper explores how considering multiple and intersectional cultural narratives might advance dementia research and benefit overlooked groups and communities. Using person-centered research approaches to understand the experiences of older Black women at risk for dementia may highlight conditions contributing to elevated risk, including economic precarity, racism, and caregiving responsibilities. A full recognition of cultural narratives about dementia informs better social policy, research, and practice.

OBJECTIVE: To examine if immune cell changes are present in early stages of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). BACKGROUND: Evidence for inflammation in synucleinopathies has been building. An extensive number of studies have documented inflammatory changes in Parkinson's disease (PD), but much less is known about DLB. Post-mortem DLB brains show T-cell infiltration, and flow cytometry and cytokine/chemokine measures in DLB subjects have suggested the presence of inflammatory responses in DLB. However, there is limited understanding if immune cell changes are present at the earliest stages of DLB. METHODS: We recruited a small, exploratory cohort of nine subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment-Lewy Bodies (MCI-LB) as part of the broader Alabama Udall cohort study, which is focused on the role of inflammation in early PD. The MCI-LB cohort was compared to subjects with de novo PD (n = 64) and healthy controls (n = 70) from the larger Alabama Udall cohort. Subjects underwent clinical assessments, including Movement Disorder Society-United Parkinson's Disease rating scale (MDS-UPDRS), and comprehensive cognitive assessment. Blood was obtained for flow cytometry and cytokine/chemokine analyses. RESULTS: Demographics and medical history were comparable between groups. Significant differences in University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living, and MDS-UPDRS scores were observed between the groups. MCI-LB subjects had poorer cognitive composite scores compared to PD participants. MCI-LB subjects demonstrated a robust 60% reduction in mature neutrophils compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Our data show changes in innate immune cells in MCI-LB compared to healthy controls in this small exploratory study. A larger cohort study is needed to validate these findings.

Dementia risk is influenced by the social conditions in which people live. These social determinants of dementia (SDOD) are potential targets for prevention. We conducted a comprehensive scoping review to identify current evidence on SDOD in two stages: (1) review of systematic reviews on SDOD; and (2) review of primary literature to address identified gaps in the evidence base. Of the 3445 articles screened, 26 reviews and 74 primary studies were included. Evidence from reviews provide clear and consistent patterns for some SDOD (e.g., education, air pollution, socioeconomic status, ethnicity), while evidence for others is still emerging (e.g., housing quality/stability), or lacking entirely (e.g., incarceration). SDOD are important over the life course. Additional evidence is needed for understudied domains and to unravel the complex interactions between determinants, whilst education and air pollution stand out as key targets for public health interventions. HIGHLIGHTS: There is clear and consistent evidence for some social determinants of dementia (SDOD) across diverse domains. Evidence for other SDOD (e.g., housing, incarceration) is still emerging or lacking. Evidence for SDOD comes mainly from high-income countries. The complex intercorrelations between SDODs demand a nuanced analytical approach. Standardized measures and longer follow-up to study SDOD are recommended.

BACKGROUND: Social interactions can have a beneficial effect on people with dementia (PWD). However, little is known about the details of social interactions in dementia, information that is useful for planning social interventions. The aim of our study was to gain a deeper insight, provided by people in dementia care, into (i) the characteristics of social interactions of PWD, (ii) which social interactions are considered as particularly important, (iii) how important social interactions are perceived, and (iv) what is perceived to increase social interactions among PWD. METHODS: Responses of 501 people in dementia care (mostly family and professional caregivers; more than three-quarters female; average age 53.5 years) provided in a structured, quantitative survey were included in this analysis. Descriptive analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The majority of PWDs' social interactions take place in their home or day care and arise from support services as well as organized activities. More than half of the participants perceived singing, telling life stories, or moving together (e.g., walking, dancing) as valuable social interactions that PWD benefit from in many ways. Positive effects (e.g., aggression, depression, positive emotions, activation) are mainly perceived for social interactions such as laughing together, touch, hugging, simply being together, or being involved in daily activities. Overall, participants rated social interactions as rather important for the course of the symptoms. A fixed social contact besides the primary caregiver and offers from the community, associations, and religious institutions are considered rather important in increasing the social interactions of PWD. CONCLUSIONS: Simple social interactions of PWD such as laughing, eating or singing together that can be realized in the home environment and in the context of organized caregiving activities are perceived most valuable. Enhancing social interactions, especially beyond the primary caregiving context, may be valuable for those living with dementia.

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD), a collection of neurodegenerative conditions, take a heavy physical, emotional, and financial toll on individuals, families, and communities. Developing effective strategies for preventing and treating these conditions, which impact millions of people in the United States, is one of the most pressing needs in biomedical research today. The National Institutes of Health has invested billions of dollars in this research, which has led to numerous scientific advances over the last decade. However, the pace of progress has not kept up with the growing needs of people living with AD/ADRD and those at risk. Consequently, the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke asked the National Academies to convene an expert committee to examine and assess the current state of biomedical research and recommend research priorities to advance the prevention and treatment of AD/ADRD. Preventing and Treating Dementia outlines these research priorities and recommends strategies to overcome barriers to progress.

BackgroundNutrition risk is common in Alzheimer's disease and is associated with symptoms of dementia, cognitive decline, institutionalization, and mortality. Family caregivers who increasingly manage nutrition needs of persons with dementia (PWD) experience high caregiver burden, low health literacy, and nutrition risk. Few interventions for informal caregivers have included nutrition.ObjectiveTo inform design of a future caregiver nutrition intervention.MethodsThis cross-sectional study used a convergent mixed methods approach to 1) assess nutrition status among PWD and caregiver dyads (measures in common included Mini Nutrition Assessment, skin carotenoid, and handgrip strength), and 2) interview caregivers to identify needs and barriers for nutrition intervention. We hypothesized caregiver nutrition literacy is associated with PWD nutrition risk. Data collected in nutrition assessment and interviews were analyzed separately then side-by-side for comparison.ResultsOf 50 dyads, 48% had at least one individual exhibiting nutrition risk, and nutrition status categories (χ(2 )= 6.25, p = 0.012) between caregivers and PWD were related. Caregiver nutrition literacy was associated with 1) PWD factors including nutrition risk (rho = 0.244), body mass index (BMI) (rho = 0.421), handgrip strength (rho = 0.283), and skin carotenoid (rho = 0.351), and 2) Caregiver factors including nutrition risk (rho = 0.304), diet quality (rho = 0.304), and BMI (rho = 0.333). Interviews with 18 caregivers found caregivers prioritize PWD nutrition, provide more PWD nutrition care since diagnosis, experience social isolation, and would attend nutrition interventions if PWD are included.ConclusionsNutrition risk was more common among caregivers when PWD demonstrated nutrition risk. Factors present in individuals within the dyad were associated with partner nutrition risk. Future research should identify effective approaches for intervening on dyadic nutrition risk.

This study aims to characterize people with dementia who were charged with criminal offences between 1995 and 2020 and describe their offending. Court cases were derived from Australian legal databases and descriptive data were manually extracted from case reports. Of 62 people variously charged with homicide, assault, child sexual assault, breach of conditions, property and larceny offences, driving offences, perverting the course of justice and arson, 46 were identified as having executive dysfunction, either as stated by medical expert witnesses or implicitly, due to conditions like Huntington's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Offending history was found to differ depending on offence type and dementia type. Executive dysfunction appears to underly offending in the sample; furthermore, some disease factors may combine to 'inhibit' or 'permit' offending. Permitting factors include executive dysfunction and younger age at time of offending; inhibitory factors include dementia-related impacts on mobility, memory and reaction speed.

INTRODUCTION: The study aimed to assess changes in the prevalence of dementia in Singapore over the past decade. METHODS: The Well-being of the Singapore Elderly (WiSE) 2023 and the WiSE 2013 studies were comprehensive, single-phase, cross-sectional surveys conducted among older adults aged ≥60 years in Singapore. WiSE 2023 included 2010 older adults and 1798 informants, whereas WiSE 2013 comprised 2565 older adults and 2421 informants. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of dementia based on the 10/66 Diagnostic Research Group (DRG) criteria was 8.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.3-10.7) in the WiSE 2023 study compared to 10% in the WiSE 2013 study (95% CI: 8.7-11.5). The proportion of those with undiagnosed dementia decreased significantly from 70.6% in WiSE 2013 to 51.5% in WiSE 2023 (p-value = 0.002). DISCUSSION: A non-significant 12% reduction (95% CI: 1.1-3.5) in dementia prevalence was observed in Singapore over a decade, based on the WiSE 2013 and WiSE 2023 studies. HIGHLIGHTS: The prevalence of dementia decreased from 10% to 8.8% over a decade in Singapore. The prevalence varied by age group, ethnicity, employment status, and health factors. The prevalence of undiagnosed dementia decreased significantly from 70.6% to 51.5%.

A network neuroscience perspective can significantly advance the understanding of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This study employed an innovative multiplex connectomics approach, integrating cortical thickness (CTH) and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in a dual-layer model to investigate network alterations in FTD subtypes across two geographically distinct sites. The cohort included groups of behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), primary progressive aphasia (PPA), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN) individuals who were analyzed from two separate sites. Site 1 included 28 bvFTD, 20 PPA, and 27 MCI participants, whereas Site 2 included 26 bvFTD, 43 PPA, and 43 CN individuals, respectively. Utilizing CTH and FDG-PET data after standard preprocessing, a multiplex network pipeline in BRAPH2 toolbox was used to derive multiplex participation coefficient (MPC) between the groups. The analysis revealed an increase in global MPC as an indicator of disease in PPA at both sites. Additionally, nodal MPC alterations in the anterior cingulate, frontal, and temporal lobes in PPA were compared with bvFTD. Comparisons with the CN showed that nodal MPC alterations were more extensive in PPA when compared with bvFTD. These findings underscore the potential utility of multiplex connectomes for identifying network disruptions in neurodegenerative disorders, offering promising implications for future research and clinical applications.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia is a neurodegenerative syndrome marked by the accumulation of disease-specific proteins and immune dysregulation, including autoimmune mechanisms involving autoantibodies. Current diagnostic methods are often invasive, time-consuming, or costly. METHODS: This study explores the use of proteome-wide autoantibody screening (PWAbS) for noninvasive dementia diagnosis by analyzing serum samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and age-matched cognitively normal individuals (CNIs). Serum samples from 35 subjects were analyzed utilizing our original wet protein arrays displaying more than 13,000 human proteins. RESULTS: PWAbS revealed elevated gross autoantibody levels in AD and DLB patients compared to CNIs. A total of 229 autoantibodies were differentially elevated in AD and/or DLB, effectively distinguishing between patient groups. Machine learning models showed high accuracy in classifying AD, DLB, and CNIs. Gene ontology analysis highlighted autoantibodies targeting neuroactive ligands/receptors in AD and lipid metabolism proteins in DLB. Notably, autoantibodies targeting neuropeptide B (NPB) and adhesion G protein-coupled receptor F5 (ADGRF5) showed significant correlations with clinical traits including Mini Mental State Examination scores. DISCUSSION: The study demonstrates the potential of PWAbS and artificial intelligence integration as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for dementia, uncovering biomarkers that could enhance understanding of disease mechanisms. Limitations include demographic differences, small sample size, and lack of external validation. Future research should involve longitudinal observation in larger, diverse cohorts and functional studies to clarify autoantibodies' roles in dementia pathogenesis and their diagnostic and therapeutic potential.

Dysregulated immune activation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This study reviews immunological biomarkers associated with FTD and its subtypes. A systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science was conducted for studies published before 1 January 2025, focusing on immunological biomarkers in CSF or blood from FTD patients with comparisons to healthy or neurological controls. A total of 124 studies were included, involving 6686 FTD patients and 202 immune biomarkers. Key findings include elevated levels of GFAP and MCP1/CCL2 in both CSF and blood and consistently increased CHIT1 and YKL-40 in CSF. Complement proteins from the classical activation pathway emerged as promising targets. Distinct immune markers were found to differentiate FTD from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with GFAP, SPARC, and SPP1 varying between FTD and AD and IL-15, HERV-K, NOD2, and CHIT1 differing between FTD and ALS. A few markers, such as Galectin-3 and PGRN, distinguished FTD subtypes. Enrichment analysis highlighted IL-10 signaling and immune cell chemotaxis as potential pathways for further exploration. This study provides an overview of immunological biomarkers in FTD, emphasizing those most relevant for future research on immune dysregulation in FTD pathogenesis.

The concept of personhood in dementia has maintained its status as the definitive approach to dementia care. Personhood works at both practical and philosophical levels to maintain the humanity of people with dementia. The project described in this article used the concept of personhood to design community-engaged research which harnessed the power of literary language to access the internal life of a person with dementia. Here we outline the design and methods in detail, homing in on our main conclusion that literary language is a powerful tool in helping diverse stakeholder groups access the person in dementia. The research comprised three inter-linked strands. In Strand One we built a corpus of dementia fiction from which we identified twelve extracts from contemporary novels offering the internal perspective of a person with dementia. Strand Two involved six weekly meetings of separate reading groups with four distinct stakeholder groups - student social workers, members of the public, family carers, and people with dementia. The four groups engaged in separate, facilitated discussions of the extracts. This aspect of the project is unique as to the best of our knowledge no previous research has analysed readers' responses to extracts of fictional characters' narration of living with dementia. Strand Three was led by a well-known writer and comprised a series of public events and outputs which engaged readers and authors of dementia fiction with the genre. A dementia fiction festival and writer workshops resulted in publication of an anthology of short stories which included stories addressing a deficiency of racial and ethnically diverse characters noted in our corpus. The article concludes by discussing how working across disciplines and sectors to engage with dementia as a cultural as well as a clinical challenge has the potential to facilitate the understanding and emphasis of personhood in dementia studies.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are devastating neurodegenerative diseases sharing significant pathologic and genetic overlap, leading to consider these diseases as a continuum in the spectrum of their pathologic features. Although FTD compromises only specific brain districts, while ALS involves both the nervous system and the skeletal muscles, several neurocentric mechanisms are in common between ALS and FTD. Also, recent research has revealed the significant involvement of nonneuronal cells, particularly glial cells such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and peripheral immune cells, in disease pathology. This chapter aims to provide an extensive overview of the current understanding of the role of glia in the onset and advancement of ALS and FTD, highlighting the recent implications in terms of prognosis and future treatment options.

BACKGROUND: To our knowledge capture-recapture techniques have not been used to estimate dementia prevalence using routinely collected data in England, nor have they been used to estimate changes in undiagnosed dementia over time. In this study we aimed to use routinely collected electronic health records to estimate the number of undiagnosed dementia cases there are in England and how this has changed over time. We also aimed to assess whether proportion of undiagnosed cases differed by age group, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation and sex. METHODS: We used routinely collected primary care data linked to hospital episode statistics from 1997 to 2018. We tabulated capture of dementia in each of the two datasets and used the Lincoln-Petersen estimator to estimate numbers of missing dementia diagnoses per year along with the estimated total number of cases and the proportion of cases identified. We calculated age and sex-adjusted prevalence of dementia for each year and used proportion of cases identified to estimate the underlying population prevalence of dementia per year. We conducted beta regression to estimate how sex, age band, deprivation and ethnic group affects the proportion of dementia cases identified, adjusting for year. RESULTS: Proportion of cases out of the estimated total that were identified, rose from 42.4% in 1997 to 84.4% in 2018. Estimated population prevalence of dementia rose from 1997 to a high of 4.4% in 2018 in those aged ≥ 65. Proportion of dementia cases identified did not vary by sex but a lower proportion of those from the South Asian ethnic group were diagnosed compared to the White population (coeff -0.115, 95% CI -0.218 to -0.011). Compared to those aged 65-74, those aged 75-84 and 85 + had higher proportions of dementia diagnosed (75-84 Coeff 0.259, 95% CI 0.153-0.366; 85 + Coeff 0.185, 95% CI 0.079-0.291). Those living in the two most deprived areas had a higher proportion of dementia diagnosed compared to the least deprived area (IMD quintile 4 vs 1 coeff 0.093, 95% CI 0.014 to 0.173, IMD quintile 5 vs 1 coeff 0.162, 95% CI 0.083 to 0.242). CONCLUSIONS: Proportion of dementia cases identified has increased over time and results indicate that underlying prevalence of dementia may be lower than previously estimated but this needs replication. Greater focus needs to be given to those with dementia onset at younger ages and those from South Asian backgrounds as dementia is relatively under-diagnosed in these groups.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is a global health challenge, particularly in Nigeria, where limited health care infrastructure, cultural stigmas, and poor awareness hinder its care. Telemedicine can improve patient outcomes, increase health care access, and support caregivers. However, challenges such as poor internet connectivity, digital literacy, and a lack of integrated strategies hinder its adoption, particularly in rural areas. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to evaluate the adoption of telemedicine for dementia care in Nigeria by highlighting existing interventions, their effectiveness, implementation challenges, and contextual barriers. It also draws on global evidence to propose culturally relevant, sustainable strategies. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) framework. Peer-reviewed articles were included if they focused on telemedicine or digital health interventions for dementia care in Nigeria or sub-Saharan Africa and published between January 2010 and February 2024. Databases searched included PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. A total of 23 articles met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Among the 23 studies, 10 (43.5%) focused on mobile health apps, 8 (34.8%) on video consultations, and 5 (21.7%) on remote monitoring tools. These interventions improved caregiver support, medication adherence, and access to specialist care. Key barriers included limited digital literacy, poor internet access, and a lack of cohesive national telemedicine policy. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need for an inclusive national telemedicine policy in Nigeria. Interventions such as mobile health, video consultations, and remote monitoring tools show potential to enhance dementia care, reduce caregiver burden, and improve health outcomes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Metaphorical language is often used to articulate the complex nature of care and can provide valuable insights about it. By analyzing the language of formal and informal caregivers of people with dementia, we aimed to understand their conceptualization of the disease, their role, and their relationship with the patient. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a study of six focus groups with caregivers of people with dementia (N = 6 formal; N = 13 informal) as part of the Swiss adaptation of the World Health Organization iSupport for Dementia program.We ran a qualitative content analysis on metaphors caregivers used to talk about dementia, their experience, and their relationship with the person affected. The analysis included metaphors identification, meaning and linguistic complexity analysis, and contextual interpretation. RESULTS: Caregivers frequently referred to people with dementia as "children" or employed natural elements to depict their burden. Metaphors reflected different aspects of caregiving. Some highlighted an individualistic perspective of maintaining independence while "patching" problems or "drowning" in challenges; others introduced a community-oriented perspective of moral dedication, such as the "mission" metaphor; others focused on the power and dependence dynamics in the person with dementia-caregiver relationship. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: While common metaphors in the discourse on dementia were absent, contextual and temporally conditioned metaphors were present. Metaphors collectively provided a multifaced view of caregiving, presenting perspectives of tension between self-care and service to others.Understanding the plurality of caregivers' experiences through metaphors can enhance the caregivers-professionals communication, improve care quality, and help address stigma and misconceptions about dementia.

BackgroundNeural flexibility (NF), a measure of dynamic functional connectivity, was associated with psychiatric diseases but has not yet been studied in Alzheimer's disease (AD).ObjectiveWe aim to evaluate whether AD is associated with alterations in NF and probe its predictive utility for AD conversion.MethodThe study included 862 older adults (461 cognitively normal (CN), 294 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 107 AD) with valid resting-state fMRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We defined the NF of a node as the number of times that a node changed its community assignment across the sliding windows, normalized by the total number of possible changes. We computed global NF and 12 functional network-specific NFs, then performed linear mixed models on NFs separately to explore the differences in these measures between our three groups. Finally, we evaluated the predictive utility of NF on dementia transition using survival analysis.ResultsNF is significantly higher in AD than CN on global NF (β = 0.002, 95% CI 0.001 to 0.004), and NF in six networks, and NF is significantly higher in MCI than CN in the visual network. Among n = 617 non-demented participants at baseline, n = 53 (8.6%) participants converted to dementia during the follow-up visits. Higher NF in the visual network was positively associated with AD transition (HR = 1.323, 95%CI 1.002 to 1.747, p = 0.049, per 1 SD in NF), controlling for age, gender, and education.ConclusionsWe found that NF during rest was higher in AD patients and predicted dementia transition. Thus, NF may be a valuable biomarker of AD; however, more validation and mechanistic studies need to be performed.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is characterized by impairments in an individual's cognitive and functional abilities. Digital cognitive assessments have been shown to be effective in detecting mild cognitive impairment and dementia, but whether they can stage the disease remains to be studied. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined (1) the correlation between scores obtained from BrainCheck standard battery of cognitive assessments (BC-Assess), a digital cognitive assessment, and scores obtained from the Dementia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS), and (2) the accuracy of using the BC-Assess score to predict dementia stage delineated by the DSRS score. We also explored whether BC-Assess can be combined with information from the Katz Index of Independence in activities of daily living (ADL) to obtain enhanced accuracy. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on a BrainCheck dataset containing 1751 patients with dementia with different cognitive and functional assessments completed for cognitive care planning, including the DSRS, the ADL, and the BC-Assess. The patients were staged according to their DSRS total score (DSRS-TS): 982 mild (DSRS-TS 10-18), 656 moderate (DSRS-TS 19-26), and 113 severe (DSRS-TS 37-54) patients. Pearson correlation was used to assess the associations between BC-Assess overall score (BC-OS), ADL total score (ADL-TS), and DSRS-TS. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the possibility of using patients' BC-OS and ADL-TS to predict their stage. RESULTS: We found moderate Pearson correlations between DSRS-TS and BC-OS (r=-0.53), between DSRS-TS and ADL-TS (r=-0.55), and a weak correlation between BC-OS and ADL-TS (r=0.37). Both BC-OS and ADL-TS significantly decreased with increasing severity. BC-OS demonstrated to be a good predictor of dementia stages, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of classification using logistic regression ranging from .733 to .917. When BC-Assess was combined with ADL, higher prediction accuracies were achieved, with an ROC-AUC ranging from 0.786 to 0.961. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that BC-Assess could serve as an effective alternative tool to DSRS for grading dementia severity, particularly in cases where DSRS, or other global assessments, may be challenging to obtain due to logistical and time constraints.

Background: Best healthcare practice for people with dementia encourages the inclusion of family members or carers, alongside enabling people with dementia to make their own decisions. Dementia care thus often includes the person with dementia, their carer, and their healthcare professional (HCP): a dementia care triad. Understanding how this triad is developed and navigated may improve future dementia care services. Methods: A longitudinal qualitative approach was used to interview 30 people with dementia, 31 family carers, and 7 healthcare professionals in England between May 2020 and March 2021. Data from three interview time points were transcribed and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Findings: The relationships within a dementia care triad were initially built on the dyadic relationship between the person with dementia and their family carer and any pre-existing relationships with their HCP. The nature and proximity of the carer to the person with dementia influenced how triadic relationships in dementia care formed and functioned, with spousal and co-resident carers more actively involved in healthcare interactions. Further positive development of a triad required confidence in the HCP, and shared perspectives on balancing the involvement of the carer and the independence of the person with dementia, with considerations of autonomy and risk, and which did not always follow a linear transition. While increased carer involvement often supported the person with dementia, it sometimes led to their exclusion. Engagement by healthcare professionals varied, reflecting inconsistencies in applying person-centred care. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest a need for clearer, more consistent approaches that support dynamic carer roles while preserving the autonomy of the person with dementia. This study provides additional considerations in relationship dynamics that inform our understanding of the dementia care triad.

BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation services are important to improve the health and quality of life of those living with dementia but remain an under-researched area, regarding a lifelong learning perspective. The purpose of this scoping review was to map the characteristics, effects, and experiences of rehabilitation services for early stage dementia that draw upon cognitive stimulation, cognitive stimulation therapy, cognitive training, cognitive rehabilitation, and/or neuropedagogical approaches. Thus, to identify if any addressed a lifelong learning perspective. METHODS: The literature search included the period 2003 to 2022 curated from the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Library, Medline, ERIC, PsycINFO, and Education Research Complete. We uploaded 204 references to Covidence, 15 of which were eligible. RESULTS: Eligible studies used many study designs with different sample sizes. The length of the interventions ranged from weeks and months to no defined periods, with a frequency of 1 to 3 times a week. The studies used various measurement tools. The services were inspired by cognitive stimulation therapy (n = 5), cognitive training (n = 2), cognitive rehabilitation (n = 4), or multiple approaches (n = 4). Most studies examined the effectiveness of the services, with only a few exploring their experience of them. There is a great variation in available services, with some showing promising but no longer-term effects. CONCLUSIONS: This review documents the importance of developing dementia rehabilitation services that focus on long-term effects and lifelong learning to ensure more efficient and relevant services in the future.

BACKGROUND: Management of dementia, particularly the use of pharmacological treatments, in the oldest old and those with frailty is complex because of the multiple types of dementia, comorbidities, polypharmacy, and side effects. Current national dementia guidelines lack recommendations for this group. This study assessed guideline awareness, usage, and pharmacological management practices for dementia in the oldest old and frail across Europe. METHODS: An online anonymous survey was distributed in 2023 to the European Geriatric Medicine Society Dementia Special Interest Group and their contacts to investigate guideline awareness and pharmacological practices for the oldest old and frail. The CHERRIES checklist was followed for reporting. Responses were summarized using descriptive statistics and quotations of free text responses. RESULTS: Forty-nine responses from fourteen countries were received. A total of 76.6% were aware of a national dementia guideline and 86.9% applied it frequently. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) were generally used as a first-line treatment in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) (91.6% and 93.4%). Memantine was added or replaced AChEIs as dementia severity progresses. Gingko biloba was considered in mild and moderate AD (23.6% and 22.7%, respectively). Off-label drug use was common in other types of dementia. 88.5% of respondents reported no difference in treatment compared with a younger population. CONCLUSION: There was awareness of various dementia guidelines, but none addressed the management of the oldest old and frail. Most respondents did not adapt their practices for this group, but many reported off-label treatments which resulted in non-evidence-based prescribing, overprescribing, and a lack of deprescribing. European consensus to guide the management of dementia in this complex population is needed.

OBJECTIVE: Efficient and early detection of cognitive impairment may be facilitated using the NIH Toolbox (NIHTB), a computerized suite of assessments measuring multiple aspects of neurological functioning. METHODS: The Advancing Reliable Measurement in Alzheimer's Disease and cognitive Aging study validated the NIHTB across a geographically diverse cognitive aging sample. Participants aged >64 with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) across nine research sites completed the NIHTB. One-way ANOVAs captured differences in performance on the Cognition Battery and effect sizes were calculated. RESULTS: Groups differed substantially across all cognition measures, with large differences in Total and Fluid Cognition, after demographic adjustment. The largest differentiators were in fluid measures, particularly for working and episodic memory. CONCLUSIONS: NIHTB-CB differentiates NC, MCI, and DAT groups. Future studies will examine longitudinal differences and performance in enriched samples (African American participants, Spanish NIHTB, 85+ years old).

There is a pressing need for accessible biomarkers with high diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis to facilitate widespread screening, particularly in underserved groups. Saliva is an emerging specimen for measuring AD biomarkers, with distinct contexts of use that could complement blood and cerebrospinal fluid and detect various analytes. An interdisciplinary, international group of AD and related dementias (ADRD) researchers convened and performed a narrative review of published studies on salivary AD biomarkers. We critically appraised the current state of the literature, examining both consistencies and discrepancies in existing pre-analytical variables and methodologies. We discussed how various pre-analytical variables could influence the detection and quantification of salivary biomarkers, showed technologies available to standardize collection procedures, and proposed a standardized pre-analytical protocol to guide future studies on salivary AD biomarker examinations. We identified potential contexts of use, gaps, and priorities and proposed future research directions. HIGHLIGHTS: Given its non-invasive nature, wider accessibility, and cultural acceptability, particularly in low-resourced settings, saliva is a biofluid complementary to blood and CSF. Current salivary AD biomarker studies do not control for many confounding pre-analytical variables during the sampling process, potentially leading to inaccurate salivary biomarker readings and conclusions, contributing to conflicting findings. Reviewing the current literature, including the consistencies and non-consistencies observed in the existing parameters and methodologies, discussing how they can affect salivary AD biomarker detection and quantification. Proposing a standardized salivary pre-analytical protocol, identifying the gaps and prioritizations needed to move this area forward, proposing future directions and potential contexts of use.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Lewy body diseases (LBD) include neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Because DLB and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share similar neurological symptoms, DLB is frequently underdiagnosed. White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) are associated with dementia risk and changes in both DLB and AD. In order to examine WMH discrepancies in DLB and AD patients and gain insight into their diagnostic utility and pathophysiological significance, this systematic review and meta-analysis is conducted. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting WMH in DLB and AD patients based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review (PRISMA) guideline. Stata version 15 US is used to analyze the extracted data. RESULTS: Twelve studies with 906 AD and 499 DLB patients were considered in this analysis. Although not statistically significant, the WMH was 0.03 ml larger in AD patients than in DLB patients. The prevalence of hypertension varied, ranging from 21% to 56% in DLB patients and from 30% to 52% in AD patients. Different findings were found on the prevalence of diabetes; some research suggested that DLB patients had greater rates (18.7%-37%) than AD patients (9%-17.5%). The imaging modalities FLAIR, T2-weighted, and T1-weighted sequences were employed. Compared to DLB patients, AD patients had higher cortical and infratentorial infarcts. CONCLUSION: Those with AD have greater WMH volumes than cases with DLB, suggesting that WMH can be a biomarker to help better differentiation between these neurodegenerative diseases; however, this difference is not significant. To better understand the therapeutic implications and options for reducing WMH-related cognitive loss in various patient populations, more research is necessary.

BackgroundThe inherent genetic effects were not established between type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD).ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate the association between T2DM and ADRD by integrating T2DM polygenic risk score (PRS) and applying matching in every subgroup.MethodsWe utilized UK Biobank First-occurrences datasets. T2DM were 1:1 matched to non-T2DM using propensity scores generated by 8 covariates; age at diagnosis, sex, cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, hypertensive disorders, lipid disorders, obesity, and mood disorders. T2DM PRS was additionally matched in T2DM PRS matched analysis. Subgroup analyses by age at diagnosis, sex, and APOE4 genotype were performed with the same matching criteria within each subgroup. Cox proportional hazard and Fine & Gray competing risk model were utilized.ResultsIn T2DM PRS unmatched cohort, 24,583 T2DM were 1:1 matched to non-T2DM. The mean age at diagnosis was around 62 years old, with females constituting around 40%. Up to 25-year follow-up, ADRD rate/1000 person-years was 0.88 versus 1.52 (Non-T2DM versus T2DM); PRS unmatched (cHR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.46-2.03) and matched (cHR:1.75, 95% CI: 1.47-2.09). Except for older age onset (≥75 years), the other subgroups demonstrated significantly increased ADRD risks in T2DM. T2DM PRS was higher in non-ADRD group across all subgroups. Contrarily, T2DM PRS was higher in ADRD in younger onset group (<55 years).ConclusionsT2DM is one of the strong risk factors of ADRD but genetic T2DM effect does not contribute to ADRD risk. However, a genetic link might be present in younger age onset group.

The Alzheimer's Association convened a Diagnostic Evaluation, Testing, Counseling and Disclosure Clinical Practice Guideline workgroup to help combat the major global health challenges surrounding the timely detection, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate disclosure of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other diseases that cause these types of cognitive-behavioral disorders. The newly published clinical practice guidelines are proposed as a structured approach to evaluation. The purpose of the present article is to provide a clinical perspective on the use of neuropsychology within the new framework and practice guidelines outlined under the Diagnostic Evaluation, Testing, Counseling and Disclosure of Suspected Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (DETeCD-ADRD) recommendations for primary care and specialty care. Neuropsychological evaluation is a critical component in supporting early and accurate diagnosis and staging, characterizing the clinical profile, assessing trajectory over time, and providing recommendations specifically tailored to the individual and their care team. HIGHLIGHTS: Reviews the neuropsychological evaluation component of the new framework and clinical practice guidelines outlined under the Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guidelines for the Diagnostic Evaluation, Testing, Counseling and Disclosure of Suspected Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (DETeCD-ADRD). Examines the utility of neuropsychological evaluation in the assessment of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD). Supports a basis for neuropsychology in early and accurate diagnosis and staging, characterizing the clinical profile, assessing trajectory over time, and providing recommendations specifically tailored to the individual and their care team.

OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among the elderly. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applies low-intensity currents to the brain, resulting in short-term neurocognitive effects and long-term neuroplasticity enhancement. Limited research reported on the impact of tDCS on cognitive functions in dementia due to AD. This study aims to compare changes in verbal fluency and working memory following a single tDCS application to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in AD patients. METHODS: Patients with mild dementia due to AD underwent cognitive assessment using the Standardized Mini-Mental Test, Clock Drawing Test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Functional Activities Questionnaire, Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale. A single-session tDCS was administered by applying anodal tDCS to the left DLPFC for a duration of 30 minutes. Verbal fluency and working memory were evaluated before and after tDCS using the WAIS-R Digit Span Test forward and backward subscales, Trail Making Test (TMT) A and B, and Verbal Fluency Test. RESULTS: Regarding cognitive test scores before and after tDCS application, there were statistically significant reductions in the durations of TMT-A and TMT-B. However, there were no significant differences observed for TMT B-A, VFT, DST-forward, and DST-backward performances. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that a single anodal tDCS targeting the left DLPFC enhances attention and processing speed in AD patients but has no effect on working memory or verbal fluency.

INTRODUCTION: The clinical utility of dementia prognostic scores has limited validity across diverse populations. This study aimed to enhance the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) model by incorporating resting heart rate (RHR) using a machine learning method across a diverse population. METHODS: We developed CAIDE and CAIDE-RHR models using a random forest algorithm in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset. Model performances were assessed using area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and the Brier score. RESULTS: Incorporating RHR into the CAIDE model significantly improved predictive accuracy across Black African, Asian, White, and Native Hawaiian populations (mean AUC range: 0.80-0.91). However, this improvement was not observed in the American Indian population, where the AUC decreased from 0.87 to 0.84. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight significant ethnic differences in dementia risk prediction models. These results underscore the need for validating and tailoring dementia risk scores to ensure applicability across diverse races. HIGHLIGHTS: Incorporating resting heart rate (RHR) into the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia (CAIDE) model significantly improves its predictive accuracy for dementia risk across diverse populations, offering a novel addition to dementia risk models. The application of the machine learning technique enhances dementia risk prediction by capturing complex, non-linear relationships among variables. The improved model enables more precise early identification of individuals at risk of cognitive decline, supporting preventive strategies in dementia care. Resting heart rate, a simple and non-invasive cardiovascular measure, is demonstrated to be a valuable predictor for dementia risk, making it practical for clinical application.

AIM: This study investigated the impact of urinary incontinence on idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) by comparing its characteristics with those of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). METHODS: Cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), and caregiver burden were compared using data from 107 patients with iNPH, 610 with AD, and 152 with DLB treated at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Osaka Hospital, through the chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Multiple regression analysis was performed to investigate factors related to dementia severity and caregiver burden in patients with iNPH. RESULTS: The iNPH group had milder cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms, except for apathy, than the other two groups but showed more dependence on ADL. Patients with iNPH did not differ significantly from those in the other two groups in terms of dementia severity. The caregiver burden was milder in the iNPH group than in the DLB group. In the iNPH group, dementia severity was related to the Mini-Mental State Examination score, urinary incontinence frequency, and apathy, whereas caregiver burden was related to apathy and irritability. Sex, age, and the Timed Up and Go test results were not related to any of these. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to AD and DLB, iNPH was characterized by urinary incontinence. Although urinary incontinence has not been extensively studied and treated, it may affect daily life more than gait disturbances and cognitive impairments in patients with iNPH.

BACKGROUND: Plasma p-tau181 has proven to be a promising diagnostic and prognostic tool in the earliest phases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of p-tau181 in predicting conversion to AD dementia and worsening in cognition in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD). METHODS: We consecutively enrolled 163 patients (50 SCD, 70 MCI, and 43 AD-demented (AD-d)), who underwent plasma p-tau181 analysis with the Simoa assay. Patients were classified according to the Revised Criteria of the Alzheimer's Association Workgroup as Core1+ or Core1- (based on amyloid-PET, CSF Aβ42/Aβ40, CSF p-tau181/Aβ42). RESULTS: Plasma p-tau181 levels were significantly influenced by Core1 status (B = 1.41, p < 0.001) and clinical diagnosis (B = 0.63, p < 0.001). Plasma p-tau181 was highly accurate in discriminating between Core1+ and Core1- patients (AUC = 0.88 [95% CI 83.00-94.00]) with a cut-off value of 2.25 pg/mL presenting good accuracy (85.90%), specificity (74.58%), and excellent sensitivity (92.78%). Classifying patients according to p-tau181 cut-off, we found that p-tau181+ patients showed an increased risk of converting to AD dementia (HR = 11.65, p = 0.018). Moreover, SCD p-tau181+ worsened over time in tasks assessing long-term verbal (p = 0.012) and spatial memory (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma p-tau181 is not only a good diagnostic marker for AD pathology, but it also plays a role as a predictor of both conversion to AD dementia and of worsening of cognitive performance since the earliest phase of AD.

OBJECTIVES: In a sample of community-dwelling older adults, we examined the association of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and whether informant type (i.e., spouse vs. child vs. other) modified that association. METHODS: This study included 430 participants with a cognitively unimpaired or mild cognitive impairment consensus diagnosis from the Wake Forest Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Clinical Core cohort. Informants reported NPS using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. AD/ADRD BBMs included the Aβ42/40 ratio, p-tau181, p-tau217, NfL, and GFAP. Generalized linear models were used to examine the associations between AD/ADRD BBMs and NPS. Secondary models adjusted for age, sex, education, race, and cognitive status. Tertiary models adjusted for covariates in secondary models, as well as informant type. Interactions between informant type and AD/ADRD BBMs were examined. RESULTS: Higher p-tau217 was associated with higher NPS in both unadjusted models and models adjusted for demographics and cognitive status. This association was attenuated and no longer statistically significant after additionally adjusting for informant type. Significant interactions of informant type and p-tau181 or p-tau217 on NPS were demonstrated, where p-tau181 or p-tau217 were more strongly associated with NPS reported by children compared to spouses. CONCLUSIONS: Informant type modified the association between AD/ADRD BBMs and NPS, with stronger associations observed when symptoms were reported by child informants compared to spouse informants. These findings have important implications for earlier detection of individuals with AD/ADRD pathologies.

INTRODUCTION: We aimed to develop and externally validate a mapping to translate Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores to Clinical Dementia Rating scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We extended a previously published CDR-SB to MMSE mapping to include later stages of AD and validated it using the US National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centers (NACC) database. Calibration and discrimination metrics were evaluated, and the mapping was validated in clinically relevant subgroups of the AD population. RESULTS: A linear MMSE to CDR-SB mapping ( CDRSB =  - 0.6809 × MMSE + 20.1982) demonstrated high goodness of fit and satisfied all validation metrics. The extended mapping performed well across subgroups, though calibration was less accurate for severe dementia patients. DISCUSSION: This MMSE to CDR-SB MMSE mapping performed generally well though caution is needed when applying this mapping to people with severe AD dementia. It could be used to help contextualize outcomes in AD clinical trials and real-world health research studies. HIGHLIGHTS: We developed a mapping between the CDR-SB and MMSE instruments, by obtaining the optimal functional form of a mapping previously published using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset and extending it to the full range of clinical severities for Alzheimer's disease. The resulting mapping was externally validated using 26,729 MMSE and CDR-SB pairs from participants recruited to the US National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centers database. The selected model satisfied the pre-specified selection criteria and the extended mapping demonstrated good performance, especially in the earlier clinical stages. However, caution is advised when inferring mapped scores in more severe dementia. The extension and subsequent validation of the mapping can support the translation of AD severity assessments between datasets using CDR-SB and MMSE, bridging a common information gap between clinical trials, real-world evidence studies, and clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown is essential in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), whereas the variability in BBB permeability to water and contrast agent is less clear. METHODS: We investigated BBB permeability to water and contrast agent simultaneously using a novel tracer kinetic model for dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in 42 AD patients, 22 DLB patients, and 22 healthy controls. All participants underwent clinical, cognitive, and MRI assessments. RESULTS: AD patients exhibited a significant reduction in the water exchange rates across the BBB, whereas DLB patients showed a significant increase in BBB permeability to contrast agent. Moreover, BBB permeability to both water and contrast agent in multiple brain regions demonstrated correlations with clinical severity. DISCUSSION: The simultaneous evaluation of BBB permeability to water and contrast agent based on the proposed model highlights the heterogeneous patterns of BBB breakdown in AD and DLB. HIGHLIGHTS: We measured blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability to water and contrast agent based on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by lower water exchange rates across the BBB. Dementia with Lewy bodies exhibits higher BBB permeability to contrast agent. BBB permeability is related to cognitive impairment and disease burden. BBB permeability to water was negatively associated with that to contrast agent.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive reserve (CR), typically measured through socio-behavioral proxies, can partially explain better cognitive performance despite underlying brain aging or neuropathology. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of CR with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitive function while considering Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related plasma biomarkers. METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study included 4706 dementia-free individuals from MIND-China. Data on AD-related plasma biomarkers were available for 1204 individuals. A composite CR score was generated by integrating education, occupational complexity, mental activity, and social support, using structural equation modeling. A neuropsychological test battery was used to assess the function of episodic memory, executive function, attention, and verbal fluency. MCI and subtypes of MCI were defined according to the Petersen's criteria. Data were analyzed using general linear and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Controlling for AD-related plasma biomarkers, higher educational attainment was associated with better performance in all four examined cognitive domains (p < 0.001) and with lower likelihoods of MCI, amnestic MCI (aMCI), and non-aMCI (p < 0.05); late-life mental activity was significantly related to lower likelihoods of MCI and aMCI (p < 0.05). Midlife occupation and late-life social support were not significantly associated with MCI or subtypes (p > 0.05). Higher composite CR scores were related to better performance in all the examined cognitive domains as well as lower likelihoods of MCI, aMCI, and non-aMCI (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Greater composite CR, derived from the CR indicators across different stages of the lifespan, is associated with better cognitive function independent of AD-related plasma biomarkers, driven mainly by early-life educational attainment.

Background. Despite the potential of palliative care (PC) to enhance the quality of life for patients with advanced dementia, there is limited knowledge of its inpatient utilization patterns. This study investigated inpatient PC consultation utilization patterns and evaluated its impact on hospital length of stay (LOS) and medical costs among older patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia who were at a high risk of mortality (ADRD-HRM). Methods. Using the 2016-2019 National Inpatient Sample database, we conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify individual and hospital characteristics influencing PC consultation utilization. We subsequently performed generalized linear models to estimate LOS (using Poisson distribution) and hospital charges (via log-transformation). Results. Our sample encompassed 965,644 hospital discharges (weighted n = 4,828,219) of patients aged 65 years and above with ADRD-HRM. Among them, 14.6% received inpatient PC. There was a notable uptrend in PC consultation utilization from 13.3% in 2016 to 16.3% in 2019 (p trend<.001). Factors positively influencing and associated with PC utilization included patients that are older, non-Hispanic White, with higher income, receiving care from teaching hospitals, and facilitated with greater bed capacity (all P < .05). Although patients who received PC were more likely to have 3.0% longer LOS (P < .001), they had 19.2% lower hospital charges (P < .001). Conclusions. PC substantially reduced hospital expenditures for older patients with ADRD-HRM, but the prevalence remained low at 14.6% in the study period. Future studies should explore the unmet needs of patients with lower sociodemographic status and those in rural hospitals to further increase their PC consultation utilization.

BACKGROUND: Dementia-friendly hospitals are increasingly discussed in healthcare, politics, research and society as a way to improve hospital stays for people with dementia. However, the perspective of people with dementia is often underrepresented, and current definitions and concepts are primarily based on the expertise of healthcare professionals. OBJECTIVES: To identify characteristics of a dementia-friendly hospital from the perspective of people with dementia. METHODS: A qualitative design embedded in a case study was used. We conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with people with dementia during their hospital stay. The interviews were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis with an inductive approach. In our study, we adopted a participatory approach and actively involved people with dementia and other stakeholders in the development of the interview guide and in the data analysis. RESULTS: The participants expect more than what's necessary from a dementia-friendly hospital, as presented by eight characteristics identified: (i) The most important thing is how we treat each other; (ii) Someone cares about ME; (iii) No hully gully! I want professional care; (iv) Focusing on my goals; (v) LOOK! I've still got capabilities; (vi) Skipping Groundhog Day; (vii) A bit of both: mingle and single, and (viii) Recognising what relatives mean to me. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the importance of involving people with dementia in the development of dementia-friendly hospitals as only they have the lived experience and a different perspective from that of healthcare professionals.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) are synucleinopathy syndromes with similar symptom profiles that are distinguished clinically based on the arbitrary rule of the time of symptom onset. Identifying reliable electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers would provide a precise method for better diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of treatment response in these two types of dementia. From April 2015 to March 2021, the records of new referrals to a neurology clinic were retrospectively reviewed and 28 DLB(70.3% male) and 20 PDD (80.8% male) patients with appropriate EEG were selected for this study. Artifact-free 60-s EEG signals (21 channels) at rest with eyes closed were analyzed using EEGLAB, and regional spectral power ratios were extracted. Marked diffuse slowing was found in DLB patients compared to PDD patients in all regions in terms of decrease in alpha and increase in theta band. Although, these findings demean between groups after adjusting for MMSE scores, the significant difference still remained in terms of the mean relative alpha powers, particularly in the anterior and central regions. QEEG measures may have the potential to discriminate between these two syndromes. However, further prospective and longitudinal studies are required to improve the early differentiation of these dementia syndromes and to elucidate the underlying causes and pathogenesis and specific treatment.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are increasingly common progressive conditions that have a substantial impact on individuals and their primary care partners-together described as a dyad. The stressors experienced by dyad members at around the time of ADRD diagnosis commonly produce clinically elevated emotional distress (ie, depression and anxiety symptoms), which can become chronic and negatively impact health, relationships, and the overall quality of life. Dyads commonly report unmet needs for early support to address these challenges early after diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: This study is part of a larger study that has the primary objective to develop, adapt, and establish the feasibility of Resilient Together for Dementia (RT-ADRD), a novel dyadic skills-based intervention aimed at preventing chronic emotional distress early after diagnosis. The present study protocol describes an open pilot of the RT-ADRD intervention. This study will allow the study team to gather feedback on intervention components, administration of study measures, issues within general protocol, and perceptions about live video interventions prior to a larger feasibility trial. METHODS: All study procedures will be conducted on the web (via phone and health care system-supported videoconferencing) to optimize accessibility, inclusion, and representativeness. Eligible dyads will include couples (up to N=10) referred from Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) clinics within 3 months of an ADRD diagnosis. Dyads will be referred by their diagnosing clinicians (eg, neurologists, geriatricians, and neuropsychologists) and screened for eligibility. Eligible dyads will have at least one member who exhibits clinically elevated emotional distress and will demonstrate capacity to consent to research participation on a standardized assessment. Consenting dyads will complete baseline assessments of emotional distress, quality of life, relationship functioning, and resiliency skills. Dyads will then participate in 6 weekly RT-ADRD sessions together (30-60 minutes each). After the conclusion of the intervention, dyad members will complete posttest assessments with similar measures as the pretest. Finally, dyads will participate together in a single 60-minute exit interview to gather information on intervention content and procedures to refine the intervention before a pilot feasibility trial. RESULTS: This study has been approved by the MSH institutional review board and is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06421545). We anticipate that the study will be completed by late 2024. CONCLUSIONS: We will use these results to administer changes and develop procedures for a pilot feasibility trial of RT-ADRD relative to a minimally enhanced control condition. Our study will allow us to gather comprehensive information on proposed RT-ADRD procedures and content and the best ways of delivering prevention-focused interventions to reduce the potential for chronic emotional distress stemming from ADRDs.

BACKGROUND: Post-stroke dementia (PSD) is a common and disabling sequela of stroke. However, the long-term incidence of PSD after an ischemic stroke and factors which predict its occurrence are incompletely understood. Linkage of large health datasets is being increasing used to study long-term outcomes after disease. We used large-scale linked data from Korea to determine the long-term incidence of PSD after ischemic stroke, and identify which factors predicted its occurrence. METHODS: From January 2008 to December 2014, patients with ischemic stroke (n = 37,553) without a history of dementia were included in a linked dataset comprising the claims database of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service and the Clinical Research Center for Stroke registry data. The outcome measure was PSD after ischemic stroke. Clinical factors evaluated included vascular risk factors, acute stroke management including reperfusion therapy, antithrombotics, and statins, stroke severity, and educational levels, were evaluated. RESULTS: Among 37,553 patients with ischemic stroke without a history of dementia (mean age: 64.9 years; 61.9% males), 6052 (16.1%) experienced PSD during a median follow-up period of 5 (interquartile range, 3.4-7.0) years. The 10-year estimated cumulative incidence of dementia was 23.5%. Age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.82 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75-1.88) and a lower educational level (illiteracy or no education HR 1.65 (CI = 1.44-1.88), 0-3 years 1.53 (CI = 1.31-1.79), 4-6 years 1.60 (CI = 1.43-1.80), 7-9 years 1.32 (CI = 1.16-1.49), 10-12 years 1.17 (CI = 1.04-1.32)) were independently associated with an elevated risk of PSD. Male sex was associated with a significantly lower risk of PSD (HR 0.86, CI = 0.79-0.92). Diabetes mellitus (HR 1.21, CI = 1.14-1.29), a history of stroke before index stroke (HR 1.31, CI = 1.21-1.41), and initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (HR 1.03, CI = 1.03-1.04) were independent risk factors for PSD. Regarding medications, the use of anticoagulation and antipsychotic medications after stroke appeared to be associated with increased PSD risk, whereas statin therapy was associated with a reduced risk. CONCLUSIONS: PSD is common with a 5- and 10-year incidence in patients with ischemic stroke without a history of dementia of 16.1% and 23.5%, respectively. Factors associated with PSD include age, female sex, lower educational level, diabetes mellitus, initial stroke severity, antipsychotics, and anticoagulants. Further studies are required to determine whether reducing those risk factors which are treatable reduces the incidence of PSD.

This is an executive summary of the recent guidance produced by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) dementia guideline group with regards to the investigation of suspected dementia. This is a sub-section of the broader SIGN 168 guideline released in November 2023. The guideline group included clinicians with expertise in Old Age Psychiatry, Neurology, Radiology, and Nuclear Medicine supported by colleagues from the SIGN and Healthcare Improvement Scotland teams. There was representation from carers and support organizations with experience of dementia, to ensure the recommendations were appropriate from the perspective of the people being assessed for possible dementia and their carers. As the 2018 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) dementia review included a review of the evidenced investigation of dementia, the SIGN guideline development group decided to focus on a review on the up-to-date evidence regarding the role of imaging and fluid biomarkers in the diagnosis of dementia. To give context to the consideration of more advanced diagnostic biomarker investigations, the guideline and this summary include the NICE guidance on the use of standard investigations as well as more specialist investigations. The evidence review supports consideration of the use of structural imaging, nuclear medicine imaging, and established Alzheimer's cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (amyloid and tau) in the diagnosis of dementia. Although routine use of amyloid positron emission tomography imaging was not recommended, its potential use, under specialist direction, in patients with atypical or young-onset presentations of suspected Alzheimer's dementia was included as a clinical good practice point.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is now being recognized as a complex illness with numerous behavioral symptoms in addition to the well-recognized motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, postural instability, and bradykinesia. Inhibitory control is one of the hallmark executive processes impaired in PD. Such deficits may severely affect the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. They may also result in impulsivity or lack of flexibility, arising as risk factors for developing impulse control disorders, which encompasses a wide range of behaviors such as compulsive gambling, buying, sexual behavior, and eating and related disorders. AIM: The present study aims at understanding the behavioral symptoms in connection with inhibitory control in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and PD without dementia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the current study, 12 individuals with cognitively unimpaired PD and 10 individuals with PDD were selected. Montreal Cognitive Assessment was used to screen cognitive impairment, and the Go-No-Go test assessed inhibitory control. A behavioral profile in connection with the inhibitory control was obtained for both groups. Further descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests were used to understand any significant difference between the groups concerning inhibitory control. RESULTS: The present study findings showed a significant difference in both groups regarding inhibitory control (P < 0.001). Apathy was the highly prevalent behavioral symptom in both groups, followed by agitation in cognitively unimpaired PD and irritability in those with PDD. In addition, increased sweet food preference, disinhibition, and stubbornness were also present in both groups. CONCLUSION: Thus, this study will help understand the behavioral profile of patients with PD and PDD concerning inhibitory control. Thus, early detection of behavioral changes in PD can aid in timely prevention of future cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption has been described to exhibit a J-shaped relationship with dementia risk, but previous observations may be partly biased due to "sick-quitters" and competing risks of death. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between baseline and lifetime alcohol consumption and the risk of dementia and subtypes in a large Mediterranean cohort, accounting for lifetime drinking patterns, potential confounding, and competing risks of death. METHODS: Prospective study of 30,211 participants, 29-69 years at recruitment (1992-1996), from the EPIC-Spain dementia cohort. Alcohol intake was assessed using a validated dietary history and retrospective questionnaires covering ages 20, 30, and 40 years. Dementia cases (n = 1,114) were ascertained through linkage with healthcare and mortality databases and individual medical record review over a mean follow-up of 22.8 years. Multivariate competing risk models were used to estimate sub-hazard ratios (sHRs) for dementia by categories of baseline and lifetime alcohol consumption, using lifetime abstainers as the reference group. RESULTS: Mean lifetime alcohol consumption was 41.9 and 4.4 g/d in men and women, respectively. No significant associations were found between baseline or lifetime alcohol consumption and risk of overall dementia (sHR(currentvs.never) = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.82, 1.13; sHR(evervs.never) = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.82, 1.11), Alzheimer's disease, or non-Alzheimer subtypes. These null findings remained consistent across strata of sex, BMI or smoking categories, and by beverage type. Sensitivity analyses excluding mis-reporters of energy intake or low-quality diagnoses yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective cohort with over 1,100 dementia cases and long-term follow-up, alcohol consumption was not significantly associated with dementia risk. These findings challenge the notion of a protective effect of moderate drinking and warrant continued investigation using methodologically rigorous approaches to clarify the role of alcohol dose, timing, and pattern on dementia risk.

AIMS: To describe the co-creation of the 'Desired Dementia Care Towards End of Life' (DEDICATED) approach to improve person-centred palliative care for individuals with dementia and to describe the experiences of healthcare professionals during the approach's implementation. METHODS: A needs assessment, comprising both qualitative and quantitative studies, informed palliative care needs of healthcare professionals, family caregivers and individuals with dementia. The approach was co-created with healthcare and education professionals, guided by the findings. Then, healthcare professionals were trained to implement the approach in their organizations. From April to June 2022, semi-structured interviews with actively engaged professionals were analysed using Conventional Content Analysis. RESULTS: The needs assessment yielded six key themes: (1) raising palliative care awareness, (2) familiarization with a person with dementia, (3) communication about future care preferences, (4) managing pain and responsive behaviour, (5) enhancing interprofessional collaboration in advance care planning and (6) improving interprofessional collaboration during transitions to nursing homes. Interviews with 17 healthcare professionals revealed that active involvement in co-creating or providing feedback facilitated implementation. Overall, the DEDICATED approach was perceived as a valuable toolkit for optimizing palliative care for people with dementia and their loved ones. CONCLUSION: Co-creating the DEDICATED approach with healthcare professionals facilitated implementation in daily practice. The approach was considered helpful in enhancing person-centred palliative dementia care. IMPACT STATEMENT: This study underscores the importance of active involvement of healthcare professionals in the research and development of new interventions or tools for palliative care, which can influence the successful implementation, dissemination and sustained usage of the developed tools. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND PATIENT CARE: The developed approach can improve person-centred palliative care for individuals with dementia, ultimately improving their quality of life and that of their loved ones. REPORTING METHOD: This study used the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. PATIENT OF PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: No patient or public contribution.

Little is known about the development, implementation, and sustainability of Dementia-Friendly Communities (DFCs) in the U.S., designed to enable people living with dementia to maintain dignity, participate in community life, and access needed services. This integrative review synthesizes evidence from 17 articles (2015-2024), examining DFC stakeholders, strategies, and barriers. Findings highlight DFCs as multi-sector collaborations that enhance well-being through person-centered design, social inclusion, and caregiver support. However, challenges such as funding shortages and rural service gaps persist. Addressing these requires sustainable funding, cross-sector partnerships, targeted rural strategies, and public education to promote equity in dementia care and engagement.

BACKGROUND: Of the people with dementia in Germany, two thirds are cared for by relatives. The Dementia Support Center in Ammerland and the surrounding area offers these relatives counselling on nursing and social issues. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the Dementia Support Center in Ammerland by investigating the expectations, experiences and wishes of relatives in relation to the Dementia Support Center. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Guided interviews were conducted with relatives of people suffering from dementia who made use of the counselling service of the Dementia Support Center. The 12 individual interviews were conducted by telephone between March and December 2023 and transcribed verbatim. The contents of the interviews were summarized using the qualitative content analysis according to Mayring in the data analysis software MAXQDA12. RESULTS: The relatives reported a high level of satisfaction with the counselling offered by the Dementia Support Center. Through the counselling they experienced a relief in caring for people with dementia. The good accessibility, high professional competence and empathetic demeanor of the care coordinators were perceived as positive. With respect to the further development of the Dementia Support Center, the relatives wanted the center to be more present and have regular events, such as family meetings. CONCLUSION: In view of demographic changes and the predicted increase in people with dementia, appropriate counselling services should be expanded and further developed in line with the needs.

BACKGROUND: Dementia presents significant challenges, including social exclusion, which can be exacerbated by public stigma. This study aimed to clarify how social distances, a common measure of public stigma, towards people living with dementia and its associated factors vary with clinical stage, presence of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and living arrangements. METHODS: The study involved 2,589 Japanese participants aged 40 to 90 years. They were exposed to one of four vignettes depicting an 80-year-old woman progressing from normal ageing to mild, moderate, and severe dementia: Vignette A (living with husband, without BPSD); Vignette B (living with husband, with BPSD); Vignette C (living alone, without BPSD); and Vignette D (living alone, with BPSD). RESULTS: Social distance showed no significant differences in the normal aging and mild stage of dementia across all vignettes. At the moderate stage, social distance was higher for individuals exhibiting BPSD, regardless of living arrangement. At the severe stage, the lowest social distance was observed towards individuals living with their family without BPSD, whereas the highest was towards those living alone, exhibiting BPSD. For Vignette A, possession of social capital (p<0.001) and having experience of social contact with people living with dementia (PLWD) (p = 0.001-0.007) were independently associated with lower social distance across all dementia stages. In addition, in the mild stage of dementia, high perceived social support (p = 0.005) and having knowledge about dementia (p = 0.036) were associated with lower social distance, but not in the moderate or severe stage of dementia. For Vignette D, possession of social capital (p≤0.001) and having experience of social contact with PLWD (p<0.001 to p = 0.006) were independently associated with lower social distance across all dementia stages. In mild dementia, female sex (p = 0.004) and knowledge about dementia (p = 0.026) were associated with lower social distance. Furthermore, in mild and moderate dementia, living in rural area (p = 0.003-0.048) was associated with lower social distance. CONCLUSIONS: Social distance is higher toward PLWD who live alone and exhibit BPSD than toward those who live with family and/or do not show BPSD, indicating a higher risk of exclusion for the former. Moreover, factors affecting social distance towards PLWD vary across different clinical stages of dementia. While greater knowledge about dementia is associated with lower social distance toward PLWD, this effect appears to be most pronounced in the mild stage. In contrast, opportunities for social contact with PLWD are crucial for achieving lower social distance across all stages of dementia. The findings underscore the need for stage-specific interventions to address stigma, with a focus on education and opportunities for social contact. Targeted efforts are especially important for promoting the inclusion of PLWD who live alone and exhibit BPSD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a type of neurodegenerative illness in which β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau protein accumulate in neurons in the form of tangles. The pathophysiological pathway of AD consists of Aβ-amyloid peptides, tau proteins, and oxidative stress in neurons and increased neuro-inflammatory response. Food and Drug Administration in the United States has authorized various drugs for the effective treatment of AD, which include galantamine, rivastigmine, donepezil, memantine, sodium oligomannate, lecanemab, and aducanumab. The major disadvantage of these drugs is that they only provide "symptomatic" relief. They are most effective in the early stages or for mild to moderate cases of the disease, but are not suitable for long-term use. Besides conventional therapies, phytochemicals have the potential to stop the progression of AD. According to research, the use of potential phytochemicals against AD has gained attention due to their potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein, metal chelation, and anti-amyloid properties. This study seeks to provide an up-to-date compilation of the most current and promising breakthroughs in AD therapy using phytochemicals. It could be concluded that phytochemicals light serve as an effective therapy for AD. However, more mechanistic investigations are needed to determine the clinical implications of phytochemicals in AD treatment.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) and dementia are significant risks in older patients after surgery. Dexmedetomidine, an α2-adrenergic agonist, has shown neuroprotective properties in preclinical models, but its role in preventing dementia in postoperative patients remains unexplored. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database from 2012 to 2020. The cohort included 59 194 older patients (≥70 years) who underwent hip fracture surgery. Patients were categorised based on postoperative dexmedetomidine use. The primary outcome was the incidence of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (ad) and vascular dementia (VaD), assessed using multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for confounders. Competing risk analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Patients administered dexmedetomidine postoperatively had a significantly lower risk of dementia compared to those who did not receive the drug [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.60]. The reduction in ad risk was more pronounced (aHR 0.38, 95% CI 0.30-0.47) compared to VaD (aHR 0.58, 95% CI 0.49-0.68). These effects persisted after adjusting for confounders, including age, sex, comorbidities, and socioeconomic factors. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to provide clinical evidence supporting dexmedetomidine's potential in reducing dementia risk, particularly ad, in older postoperative patients. Further randomised trials are needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal use of dexmedetomidine in postoperative care. If validated, dexmedetomidine could become a critical strategy in reducing the long-term cognitive burden in ageing populations.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hearing impairment is a major clinical issue in dementia. Acoustically altered speech (AAS) is a typical real-world listening challenge, but markers of AAS perception, especially in frontotemporal dementias (FTDs), remain undefined. We investigated whether AAS perception differentiates FTD syndromes and predicts real-world hearing symptoms. METHODS: In this cross-sectional case-control study, participants meeting diagnostic criteria for FTD and primary progressive aphasia syndromes were recruited at a UK tertiary center. Participants performed pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and 3 AAS perception tests: speech-in-babble (SIB), spectrally filtered speech (SFS), and time-compressed speech (TCS). Real-world hearing abilities were assessed through the modified Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap (mAIAD). Group characteristics were compared using analysis of variance and Fisher exact tests. Regression models adjusted for PTA and Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence Matrices scores compared group performance on AAS tests. The Spearman test examined correlations with mAIAD scores. RESULTS: Among 44 participants, the mean (SD) age was 66 (6.23) years and 13 (29.5%) were female. 29 patients with FTD (6 with nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA [nfvPPA], 8 with semantic variant PPA [svPPA], and 15 with behavioral variant FTD [bvFTD]) were compared with 15 age-matched controls. Patients with nfvPPA had significantly higher mean PTA thresholds than controls (mean difference 12 decibels [95% CI 0.7-23.4], p = 0.034). Those with nfvPPA performed significantly worse on the SFS test than all other groups (vs controls: difference 6.3 [9.4-3.1], p < 0.001; vs svPPA group: difference 2.4 [0.5-7.3], p = 0.0018; vs bvFTD group: difference 2.0 [1.45-7.0], p = 0.0012) and significantly worse on the TCS test than controls and patients with bvFTD (vs controls: difference 88.2 [29.7-146.7], p < 0.01; vs bvFTD group: difference 76.1 [26.7-125.5], p < 0.01). The svPPA group performed significantly worse than controls on TCS (difference 57.4 [16.38-98.4], p = 0.01). Patients with nfvPPA (difference 27.2 [9.3-45.2], p < 0.001) and svPPA (difference 25.7 [11.8-39.5], p = 0.0013) had significantly worse mAIAD scores than controls. Over the combined patient cohort, mAIAD scores correlated more strongly with AAS than PTA thresholds (TCS, ρ = 0.64, p < 0.001; SFS, ρ = 0.53, p = 0.003; SIB, ρ = 0.5, p = 0.004; PTA, ρ = 0.37, p = 0.028). DISCUSSION: AAS perception stratifies FTD syndromes and constitutes a "real-world audiogram" in these diseases.

Dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) can present with a wide range of symptoms depending on its location and the degree of arteriovenous shunting. Rarely, they may manifest as cognitive impairment due to chronic venous dysfunction. This is the case of an elderly man evaluated for subacute onset of memory loss without dementia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a subtle subarachnoid vascularity in the right occipital lobe, without cerebral edema or parenchymal abnormality. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) confirmed a low-flow Borden type III DAVF, draining via an occipital cortical vein into the basal vein of Rosenthal and the vein of Galen. Subjective cognitive symptoms resolved following successful treatment with transarterial Onyx embolization. The role of DAVFs in mild cognitive impairment without dementia is likely underrecognized due to their rarity and inherent difficulties in diagnosis. This suggests a potential role for detailed cognitive evaluation in guiding the management of DAVFs.

OBJECTIVE: The myokine irisin, a recent positive mediator of exercise in the brain, shows neuroprotective functions against Alzheimer's disease (AD). The association between irisin and cognition has never been explored in a biologically defined cohort of patients. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the association of irisin with multidomain cognition in patients showing dementia-related symptomatology. METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum irisin levels were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunoassays in a cohort of subjects with a confirmed biomarker evidence of AD, including AD (n = 82), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 44), and subjective memory complaint (SMC, n = 20) patients. The results of this analysis were correlated with global cognitive efficiency assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination, and multidomain cognition evaluated by a battery of psychometric tests. RESULTS: Decreased CSF and serum irisin levels were observed in AD and MCI patients compared to SMC. A significant correlation has been found between irisin in the CSF and global cognitive efficiency, as well as with specific cognitive domains such as memory, executive functions, attention, visuospatial abilities, and language. For serum irisin, the correlation analysis evidenced similar results to those observed for the CSF. INTERPRETATION: Our results highlight the key involvement of irisin in multidomain cognition, indicating its potential role as a cognitive biomarker of AD progression.

Everyday technologies, like smartphones, might improve care of persons living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (PLWADRD) and reduce burden among care partners. However, care partners often report inadequate technical skills for using technology-based strategies. To address this need, we developed a manualized behavioral intervention called Technology Assistance in Dementia (Tech-AiD). We gathered feedback on the intervention concept from invested partners (10 care partners and 10 healthcare professionals) in a multimethod study. Quantitative results suggested very high intervention acceptability (4.55/5), appropriateness (4.36/5), and feasibility (4.11/5). Qualitative responses indicated a willingness to participate in Tech-AiD if available, described the program as a good fit for the needs of persons living with ADRD and care partners, and suggested that Tech-AiD's delivery format was convenient. Qualitative responses also included specific suggestions to improve Tech-AiD (e.g., creation of a technology helpline, booster sessions). Results provide evidence of Tech-AiD's readiness for a pilot trial.

IMPORTANCE: Active travel modes, such as walking and cycling, are feasible and readily embraced forms of physical activity, but their association with dementia risk and brain structure remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the long-term association between travel modes and dementia risk and brain structural metrics and to evaluate whether genetic predisposition could modify the association between travel modes and dementia risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study included data collected from the UK Biobank from March 13, 2006, to October 1, 2010. Data were analyzed from March to October 2024. EXPOSURES: Travel modes assessed using the question "In the last 4 weeks, which forms of transport have you used most often to get about (not including any journeys to and from work)?" and categorized into 4 groups: nonactive, walking, mixed-walking, and cycling and mixed-cycling mode. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The incidence of all-cause dementia (including young-onset dementia [YOD] and late-onset dementia [LOD]) was the primary outcome, and dementia subtypes, such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and brain structure, were the secondary outcomes; all were identified through hospital records and death registers. Brain structure was measured by a magnetic resonance imaging scan. Travel mode and risk of incident dementia were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models with hazard ratios and 95% CIs. RESULTS: The study encompassed 479 723 participants (mean [SD] age, 56.5 [8.1] years; 260 730 females [54.4%]), including 271 690 in the YOD analyses and 334 939 in the LOD analyses. Over a median follow-up of 13.1 years (IQR, 12.8-13.5 years), 8845 cases of dementia (1.8%) and 3956 cases of AD (0.8%) were recorded. Compared with a nonactive travel mode, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for cycling and mixed-cycling were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.91) for all-cause dementia, 0.78 (95% CI, 0.66-0.92) for AD, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.38-0.95) for YOD, and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.75-0.93) for LOD. A significant interaction between travel mode and genetic susceptibility in the all-cause dementia analysis (P = .02 for interaction) and the LOD analysis (P = .04 for interaction) was observed; specifically, for the cycling and mixed-cycling groups, the risks of all-cause dementia and LOD were lower among those without apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) carrier status (all-cause dementia: hazard ratio [HR], 0.74 [95% CI, 0.63-0.87]; LOD: HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.63-0.89]) compared with those with APOE ε4 carrier status (all-cause dementia: HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.76-1.02]; LOD: HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.78-1.05]). The cycling and mixed-cycling mode was significantly associated with a higher hippocampal volume (β, 0.05 [95% CI, 0.02-0.08]). Genetic risk significantly modified the association with all-cause dementia (P = .02 for interaction) and LOD (P = .04 for interaction). Specifically, for the cycling and mixed-cycling groups, the risk of all-cause dementia was lower among those without APOE ε4 (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.63-0.87]) compared with those with APOE ε4 (HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.76-1.02]). Similarly, the risk of LOD was lower among those without APOE ε4 (HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.63-0.89]) compared with those with APOE ε4 (HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.78-1.05]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cohort study suggest an association between active travel mode and incident dementia and brain structure. The cycling and mixed-cycling mode was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause dementia, including YOD, LOD, and AD, as well as an increased hippocampal volume, suggesting a promising approach for maintaining brain health.

BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the capability of cortical microstructural measures from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia, compared to commonly used macrostructural measures. Identification of high-risk individuals can support both clinical practice and trials. METHODS: Structural and diffusion MRI scans of 826 participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) were analyzed to extract macrostructural measures and three minicolumn-related diffusivity metrics: AngleR, PerpPD(+), and ParlPD. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to investigate time to progression to dementia, with participants stratified by biomarker metrics. RESULTS: Cortical diffusivity (PerpPD(+) in medial-temporal and connected regions) outperformed hippocampal volume, cortical volume, and cortical thickness in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, predicting faster conversion to dementia. DISCUSSION: Cortical microstructural measures from diffusion MRI provide powerful biomarkers for predicting progression from MCI to dementia, offering enhanced prognostic capabilities that could support earlier intervention strategies in clinical practice and improve the power of clinical trials. HIGHLIGHTS: Cortical minicolumn-related diffusivity metrics measure neurodegeneration. We compare the predictive value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures for mild cognitive impairment to dementia progression. Microstructural cortical disarray outperforms macrostructural markers. These results support using diffusion MRI biomarkers to identify and monitor at-risk patients.

Dementia is a growing global health issue, and early identification and intervention are crucial for delaying or preventing its onset. Traditional memory clinics often lack the capacity for continuous monitoring and personalized feedback on lifestyle changes that can reduce dementia risk. Digital technologies, especially mobile apps, offer a solution to this gap. This paper presents the development of a dementia risk assessment tool within the LETHE mobile app, part of a European initiative to prevent cognitive decline in at-risk elderly individuals.

INTRODUCTION: Language impairments have not yet been fully explored in native Arabic speakers with semantic dementia (SD). The aim of this paper is to describe the impairments in language in two Saudi Arabians with SD and to determine if their word reading within a sentence context would result in incorrect responses. METHODS: Two patients with semantic dementia (one with right > left and the other with left > right temporal involvement) underwent a reading assessment in Arabic. Patients were asked to read a series of words within a sentence context in which the correct reading of the word was dependent on the context of the sentence. Thirty-four sentences were designed in which 17 Arabic homographs were used. The same homograph would occur in two separate sentences, in which the pronunciation and meaning would differ between sentences. Patients were also assessed using five other sentences that contained irregular pronouns of high frequency. Eighteen healthy controls were used as reference. RESULTS: Both patients made errors in reading the target Arabic homographs; this was more pronounced in the patient with left > right variant of SD. The patient with right > left variant of SD also suffered from prosopagnosia. CONCLUSION: Correct reading of Arabic words within the sentence context may be impaired from semantic language impairments in semantic dementia. The role of comprehension in the correct reading of words in Arabic sentences is important.

PURPOSE: People living with dementia and their care partners identify interactions with the healthcare system as among their greatest challenges. Many hospital staff do not feel prepared to care for people living with dementia. This contributes to poor outcomes for patients living with dementia, frustration and confusion for care partners, and distress for hospital staff. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An academic project team with expertise in education, geriatrics, simulation, and community engagement, who had previously developed dementia-friendly training materials for classroom and community use, designed a dementia-friendly hospital toolkit. Applying principles of user-centered design, the project team consulted with care partners of people living with dementia, hospital staff, hospital leadership, and advocates from communities disproportionately impacted by dementia to identify and address the needs of patients, care partners, hospital staff, and hospital leadership. RESULTS: The project team developed a dementia-friendly hospital toolkit, which includes training materials for hospital staff across roles and an organizational guide to facilitate uptake by a wide range of hospitals. In multiple rounds of pilot testing, hospital staff rated toolkit training activities highly, reporting new insights and applying the knowledge or skills gained in their professional roles. Five hospitals, ranging from large academic centers to rural critical access hospitals, used the toolkit to assess needs, develop plans, and organize training sessions for staff. All hospitals reported receiving positive feedback from staff, meeting staff learning objectives, and intending to continue using the toolkit to meet their dementia-friendly goals. CONCLUSION: Following an inclusive, user-centered approach to developing dementia-friendly training materials allowed the project team to address the needs of key partners: people living with dementia, their care partners, hospital staff, and hospital leadership. Based on the positive responses from hospital pilot partners, the project team is supporting wider dissemination of the dementia-friendly hospital toolkit.

Behavioural changes are a central feature of frontotemporal dementia (FTD); they occur in both behavioural-variant (bvFTD) and semantic dementia (SD)/semantic-variant primary progressive aphasia subtypes. In this study, we addressed two current clinical knowledge gaps: (i) are there qualitative or clear distinctions between behavioural profiles in bvFTD and SD; and (ii) what are the precise roles of the prefrontal cortex and anterior temporal lobes in supporting social behaviour? Resolving these conundrums is crucial for improving diagnostic accuracy and for the development of targeted interventions to treat challenging behaviours in FTD. Informant questionnaires to assess behavioural changes included the Cambridge Behavioural Inventory-Revised and two targeted measures of apathy and impulsivity. Participants completed a detailed neuropsychological battery to permit investigation of the relationship between cognitive status (including social-semantic knowledge, general semantic knowledge and executive function) with behaviour change in FTD. To explore changes in regional grey matter volume, a subset of patients had structural MRI. Diagnosis-based group comparisons were supplemented by a transdiagnostic approach that encompassed the spectrum of bvFTD, SD and 'mixed' or intermediate cases. Such an approach is sensitive to the systematic graded variation in FTD and allows the neurobiological underpinnings of behaviour change to be explored across an FTD spectrum. We found a wide range of behavioural changes across FTD. Although quantitatively more severe on average in bvFTD, as expected, the item-level analyses found no evidence for qualitative differences in behavioural profiles or 'behavioural double dissociations' between bvFTD and SD. Comparisons of self and informant ratings revealed strong discrepancies in the perspective of the caregiver versus the patient. Logistic regression revealed that neuropsychological measures had better discriminative accuracy for bvFTD versus SD than caregiver-reported behavioural measures. A principal component analysis of all informant questionnaire domains extracted three components, interpreted as reflecting: (i) apathy; (ii) challenging behaviours; and (iii) activities of daily living. More severe apathy in both FTD subtypes was associated with: (i) increased levels of impaired executive function; and (ii) anterior cingulate cortex atrophy. Questionnaire ratings of impaired behaviour were not correlated with either anterior temporal lobe atrophy or degraded social-semantic knowledge. Together, these findings highlight the presence of a wide range of behavioural changes in both bvFTD and SD, which vary by degree rather than quality. We recommend a transdiagnostic approach for future studies of the neuropsychological and neuroanatomical underpinnings of behavioural deficits in FTD.

BACKGROUND: Visual impairment is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and hallucinations in older adults, but associations with other neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia have not been examined. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS), a nationally representative sample of the US population aged 70+ years. Vision was measured by self-report and using a near card. Dementia was ascertained through cognitive testing with expert consensus, and NPS were screened using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. We used logistic regression to measure the association between visual impairment and prevalent NPS adjusting for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities. Analyses incorporated sample weights to account for the complex survey design of ADAMS. RESULTS: Of 624 participants with dementia, 332 (53%) had self-reported visual impairment and 193 (31%) had best-corrected acuity of 20/40 or worse. In unadjusted models, self-reported visual impairment was significantly associated with hallucinations (OR 2.88; 95% CI 1.12-7.44), depression (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.7-4.57), and agitation (OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.05-2.48). Reduced visual acuity was associated with hallucinations (OR 10.13; 95% CI 2.93-34.98), psychosis (OR 6.69, 95% CI 2.53-17.7), and mania (OR 5.92, 95% CI 1.77-19.82). However, these associations did not remain significant after covariate adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Visual impairment was associated with hallucinations, depression, agitation, psychosis, and mania in patients with dementia, but at least some of this relationship is explained by age, comorbidities, and other factors.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between regional adiposity and dementia remains poorly understood. METHODS: This study included 440 861 UK Biobank participants initially free of dementia, stroke and cancer. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of dementia across quartiles of waist circumference (WC) or hip circumference (HC) were calculated, after multivariable adjustment with mutual adjustment for WC and HC. The potential mediating roles of 21 biomarkers covering distinct metabolic pathways were assessed. In a subsample with body composition quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, the associations of android and gynoid fatness with magnetic resonance imaging-derived volumetric brain measures were further assessed. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 12.7 years, there were 2899 incident cases of dementia in females and 3306 cases in males. After multivariable adjustment, WC was positively associated with the risk of dementia (predominantly vascular dementia) in both sexes, but the associations disappeared after further adjusting for the treatments for metabolic disorders. HC was inversely associated with dementia both in females (HR(Q4 vs. Q1) = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.86; P-trend < 0.001) and in males (HR(Q4 vs. Q1) = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.95; P-trend = 0.018), with the leading mediator being apolipoprotein B (11.15%) and vitamin D (9.03%) for female and male associations, respectively. In both sexes, gynoid fat percent was related to larger grey matter volumes (β (female) = 1.21; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.68; β (male) = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.28, 1.64) and smaller volumes of white matter hyperintensities (β (female) = -1.96; 95% CI: -2.50, -1.43; β (male) = -2.57; 95% CI: -3.39, -1.76). CONCLUSIONS: Android and gynoid adipose tissues may exert divergent influences on the development of dementia, with evidence for shared and distinct mechanisms between sexes.

Frontotemporal dementia is a group of neurodegenerative disorders mainly characterized by behavioural and language impairments. While the precise pathophysiology remains elusive, emerging evidence points to an important role of dopamine dysfunction, particularly within the caudate nucleus. Moreover, a theoretical model proposes that frontotemporal dementia manifestations result from a deficit in goal-directed behaviour, which may be related to altered dopamine control of the frontostriatal circuitry. However, no study has investigated the gradient of striatal dopamine transporter levels in frontotemporal dementia using neuroimaging and their correlation with clinical features. This study used (123)I-Ioflupane Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography imaging to measure striatal dopamine transporter levels and their distribution patterns in frontotemporal dementia, compared to Parkinson's disease and healthy controls. Additionally, we explored the correlation between dopamine transporter uptake and two key domains affected in frontotemporal dementia: social cognition and language abilities. We hypothesized that frontotemporal dementia would show a predominant dopaminergic deficit in the caudate, and that this would correlate with the severity of clinical core features. The study comprised 139 participants, including 34 sporadic and genetic frontotemporal dementia, 68 Parkinson's disease individuals, and 37 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Among the frontotemporal dementia group, 22 cases had clinically probable behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, and 12 had primary progressive aphasia. Social cognition was assessed with the abbreviated version of the Social and Emotional Assessment, which includes a Theory of Mind test and a Facial Emotion Recognition Task. Language skills were evaluated with the Screening for Aphasia in NeuroDegeneration battery. We found that dopamine transporter levels were reduced in frontotemporal dementia compared to healthy controls (P < 0.001) and that frontotemporal dementia showed a higher putamen-to-caudate ratio than Parkinson's disease (P < 0.001), particularly notable in patients with identified disease-causing mutation. We also found that dopamine transporter levels were correlated with parkinsonian motor features and general cognition in frontotemporal dementia. Notably, both social cognition-especially facial emotion recognition-and language abilities exhibited associations with dopamine transporter levels in both the putamen and the caudate. These findings suggest that the pattern of dopamine transporter uptake could serve as a valuable biomarker for frontotemporal dementia, shedding light on the role of the dopaminergic system and the striatum in some fundamental clinical aspects. This opens new avenues for further investigating the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets of the dopaminergic projections in frontotemporal dementia.

BACKGROUND: Dementia represents a growing healthcare challenge in the United States. The Care Ecosystem, an effective collaborative care model, bridges medical and social care needs for individuals with dementia. The purpose of this study was to describe how the Care Ecosystem has been disseminated and the lessons learned from this experience. METHODS: Interested site leaders from both health systems and community-based organizations reviewed online implementation support materials and consulted with Care Ecosystem directors. Those that decided to move forward with implementation were invited to join monthly 'Implementation Meetings.' Observations of these meetings and review of minutes were combined with site surveys and interviews, which were analyzed using qualitative and descriptive methods. RESULTS: Implementation efforts resulted in the adoption of the Care Ecosystem at 28 health systems and eight community-based organizations, including 22 participants in Medicare's Guiding an Improved Dementia Experience (GUIDE) payment model. The Implementation Meetings facilitated collaborative learning and adaptation and supported fidelity to core model elements. The Care Ecosystem's flexible approach and open-source materials enabled tailored implementations that align with local contexts and population needs. CONCLUSIONS: The Care Ecosystem exemplifies a scalable approach to dementia care, guided by implementation science principles to bridge the gap between research and real-world application. Its success in improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs underscores its potential to enhance dementia care delivery on a broader scale. Future efforts should focus on refining implementation strategies, enhancing fidelity monitoring, and expanding partnerships to sustain and scale effective dementia care practices across diverse healthcare settings.

Background: People living with advanced dementia risk being seen as someone without personhood in contemporary societies, an understanding that has been described and challenged for decades in dementia scholarly literature. Such perception can be characterised as forms of existential dehumanisation, which still asserts itself in dementia care practices, adversely affecting the ethical and caring aspects of such care.Aim: To challenge dehumanisation in dementia care, we must first learn to recognise what foster it in caring relations. Thus, the aim of our study is to identify existing perceptions of care recipients living with advanced dementia, which elicit dehumanising attitudes among formal caregivers.Research design: We conducted an integrative review based on Whittemore and Knafl's updated methodology. This allowed us to identify and analyse 26 articles incorporating both qualitative- and quantitative studies as well as theoretical- and grey literature all describing perceptions of care recipients living with dementia that lead to dehumanisation.Ethical considerations: Studying the darker sides in caring relations was to be beneficial in improving dementia care practices.Findings: Through an analytical process five themes that can sprout dehumanising attitudes in caring relations were identified, which include perceiving people living with advanced dementia as (1) absurd, (2) shadow, (3) perilous, (4) void, or (5) repugnant. We argue that these perceptions can be seen as unintentional and stem from a misled embodied perception, which caregivers should learn to recognise and consequently be able to resist through virtue ethics.Conclusion: Our study indicates that challenging dehumanisation is a practical matter of identifying and reacting in a timely way to ones misled embodied perceptions. We suggest the five themes offer a potential means to warn formal caregivers of impending dehumanising attitudes and help them to review how they ethically are thinking and perceiving the person living with advanced dementia.

This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed data from 2011 to 2021 across 154 countries to explore the relationship between gender equality, measured by the Gender Equality Index (GEI), female dementia incidence, and gender disparities at global and regional levels. Higher GEI scores were linked to elevated dementia incidence among women and an expanding female-male disparity, with the strongest associations observed in resource-limited countries undergoing rapid social and lifestyle transitions. Multiple regression identified GEI as the most significant predictor of both female dementia incidence and gender disparity, while economic affluence and urbanization showed no independent effects. Findings highlight a paradox: although gender equality advances women's access to education, employment, and healthcare, it may simultaneously increase exposure to dementia-related risk factors, including chronic stress, work-life imbalance, and lifestyle changes such as greater smoking and alcohol use. These results emphasize the importance of gender-sensitive public health strategies that address unintended health consequences of social progress. Interventions should prioritize stress management, workplace mental health, and lifestyle modification while accounting for disproportionate caregiving responsibilities, thereby supporting equitable cognitive health outcomes for women worldwide.

Delusions are common symptoms of dementia and are clinically significant. The objective of this scoping review is to identify possible neural correlates. MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID) and Web of Science were searched in December 2020 for the keywords 'delusions' and 'dementia'. Two informal searches were carried out subsequently. Results were limited to those in English. Intervention and study characteristics were extracted using standardised tools. Eighteen published studies, using four distinct experimental methods, were included, and 31 brain regions were identified as correlates of delusions. No region was identified consistently within included studies or found in more than four studies. Despite the range of brain regions identified, a number form part of the default mode network, the salience network or the central executive network. We explore the implications of these findings for understanding delusions in dementia.

Frontotemporal dementia is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by frontal and temporal lobe degeneration, resulting in behavioral changes, language difficulties, and cognitive decline. In this study, smallRNA sequencing was conducted on postmortem brain tissues obtained from the frontal and temporal of FTD patients with GRN, MAPT, or C9ORF72 mutations. Our analysis identified miR-129-5p as consistently deregulated across all analyzed mutation conditions and brain regions. Functional investigations in in-vitro models revealed a novel role of miR-129-5p in astrocytes, where its loss led to neuroinflammation and impaired neuronal support functions, including reduced glutamate uptake. Depletion of miR-129-5p in astrocytes also resulted in the loss of neuronal spines and altered neuronal network activity in a cell culture system. These findings highlight miR-129-5p as a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases and also sheds light on the role of astrocytes in Frontotemporal dementia pathogenesis.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is commonly accompanied by cognitive dysfunction and dementia, which, in turn, increase the risk of hospitalization, cardiovascular events and death. Over the last 30 years, only four studies focused on genetic markers of cognitive impairment in CKD and kidney failure (KF), indicating a significant gap in research. These studies suggest potential genetic predispositions to cognitive decline in CKD patients but also underscore the necessity for more comprehensive studies. Seventeen reports have established connections between cognitive function and kidney disease markers such as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), Cystatin C and albuminuria. A rapid eGFR decline has been associated with cognitive deterioration and vascular dementia, and mild to moderate eGFR reductions with diminished executive function in elderly men. Various biomarkers have been associated to Alzheimer's disease or dementia in CKD and KF. These include amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau proteins, uremic toxins, gut microbiota, metabolic indicators, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, vitamins and inflammation. However, the causal relevance of these associations remains unclear. Overall, the available evidence points to a complex interplay between the different biomarkers and cognitive health in CKD patients, underscoring the need for more research to elucidate these relationships.

BACKGROUND: Hearing loss poses a significant global public health concern associated with cognitive decline. Among the many risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD), hearing loss is the most prevalent sensory impairment in older adults and has emerged as a significant, yet often overlooked, modifiable risk factor for dementia. OBJECTIVES: To access 1) the association between diet and risk of hearing loss in older adults and 2) the modifying effect of diet on the impact of hearing loss on cognitive decline in an aging population. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study SETTING: The Chicago Health and Aging Project, a community-based cohort study PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5,145 older adults (62 % non-Hispanic Black, 63 % female). MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported hearing ability was assessed during each cycle of data collection. Diet was assessed by a 144-item Food Frequency Questionnaire. Diet quality was evaluated using a 144-item Food Frequency Questionnaire, focusing on adherence to dietary patterns such as Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean, and Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND). Cognitive function assessment was conducted during the in-home visits at each cycle. Four cognitive tests, including the East Boston tests of immediate and delayed recall, the mini-mental State Examination, and the Symbol Digit Modalities test, were included. We used linear mixed effect models to examine 1) the association of hearing loss and cognitive decline and 2) the association of diet on cognitive decline through modifying risk hearing loss. Discrete-time survival analysis examined the association between dietary patterns and the time to hearing impairment. RESULTS: Among 5,145 participants included in the analyses, 747 (14.5 %) reported hearing loss, including 207 Black adults and 199 White adults. Each unit increase in the DASH, MedDiet, and MIND scores was associated with 19 % (95 % CI: 0.79, 0.94, P < 0.001), 11 % (95 % CI: 0.79, 1.00, P = 0.05), and 13 % (95 % CI: 0.87, 0.99, P < 0.05) lower risk for hearing loss, respectively. High adherence to the Western diet was associated with an earlier onset of hearing loss up to 14 months (P < 0.05). Participants had an increased rate of cognitive decline after reporting hearing loss. During follow-up, participants in the highest tertile of the DASH diet score who reported hearing loss experienced a 17 % faster cognitive decline (β = -0.07 ± 0.01) compared to those without hearing loss (β = -0.06 ± 0.003). However, this decline was significantly slower than that of participants observed in the lowest tertile of the DASH diet, who exhibited a 67 % faster cognitive decline (β = -0.10 ± 0.012, P = 0.05). DISCUSSION: Healthy dietary patterns, particularly the DASH diet, was associated with a reduced risk of hearing loss and slower cognitive decline following hearing loss. Clinically, these findings underscore the importance of dietary quality in preserving cognitive health by potentially mitigating risk of hearing loss or delaying the onset of hearing loss in older adults.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Symptoms indistinguishable from behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) can develop in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension associated with severe brain sagging. An underlying spinal CSF leak can be identified in only a minority of these patients and the success rate of nondirected treatments, such as epidural blood patching and dural reduction surgery, is low. The disability associated with bvFTD sagging brain syndrome is high and, because of the importance of the venous system in the pathophysiology of CSF leaks in general, we have investigated the systemic venous circulation in those patients with recalcitrant symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records and imaging studies of 21 consecutive patients with bvFTD sagging brain syndrome in whom no spinal CSF leak could be found and who underwent imaging of the systemic venous circulation (MR- or CT-venography). An SIH Disability Assessment Score (SIHDAS) questionnaire was completed to assess the severity of the symptoms. RESULTS: The mean age of the 3 women and 18 men was 50 years (range, 26-68 years). Seven patients were found to have venous stenosis. Endovascular stent placement of moderate to high-grade azygos vein stenosis in 3 patients resulted in prompt and remarkable improvement of symptoms in 2 patients (SIHDAS: very severe disability to no or mild disability) and mild improvement in 1 patient (SIHDAS: very severe disability to severe disability). Treatment of internal jugular vein and inferior vena cava stenosis in 2 patients each did not result in any improvement of symptoms. Endovascular (5 patients) or surgical (2 patients) interruption of multiple epidural spinal venous pathways did not result in any clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The azygos vein is the main conduit between the spinal CSF space and the systemic venous circulation and this study demonstrates that isolated azygos vein stenosis may be a cause of spinal CSF loss and sagging brain syndrome. In this study, the yield of finding a clinically important treatable venous lesion among patients with recalcitrant bvFTD sagging brain syndrome was relatively low (15%). However, high quality and safe noninvasive imaging of the systemic venous system is available, eg, MR-venography, and should be considered for those patients who have exhausted treatments for this devastating condition, focusing on the azygos system.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant challenge in healthcare, highlighting the necessity for early and precise diagnostic tools. Our model, DAMNet, processes multi-dimensional AD data effectively, utilizing only 7.4 million parameters to achieve diagnostic accuracies of 98.3 % in validation and 99.9 % in testing phases. Despite a 20 % pruning rate, DAMNet maintains consistent performance with less than 0.2 % loss in accuracy. The model also excels in handling 3D (Three-Dimensional) MRI data, achieving a 95.7 % F1 score within 805 s during a rigorous three-fold validation over 200 epochs. Furthermore, we introduce a novel parallel intelligent framework for early AD detection that improves feature extraction and incorporates advanced data management and control. This framework sets a new benchmark in intelligent, precise medical diagnostics, adeptly managing both 2D (Two-Dimensional) and 3D imaging data.

OBJECTIVES: This study describes the cultural adaptation of Cuidando Juntos (derived from the evidence-based Caregiver Thrive, Learn, Connect) for Latino dementia caregivers, guided by the Cultural Adaptation Behavioral Stage Model, and presents preliminary findings from a Stage Ia trial evaluating preliminary program acceptability. METHODS: A Community Advisory Board comprising Latinas from three U.S. regions collaborated with a bilingual research team to inform adaptations. All modifications were documented using the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications - Enhanced (FRAME). A Stage Ia trial of the adapted intervention was conducted with five Latino caregivers. Post-intervention, participants completed a focus group; data were analyzed using rapid qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Nineteen adaptations were made: 13 pre-trial and six after trial completion. Adaptations focused on content alignment with cultural values, dementia-specific modules, and goal-setting exercises to increase social connection. Qualitative feedback from participants and facilitators indicated high satisfaction, practical utility, and cultural relevance. Three themes were identified from the qualitative feedback: extending session time, expanding content, and increasing group activities. CONCLUSIONS: The adaptation process was systematic, community-driven, and culturally responsive. Preliminary findings support the program's acceptability among Latino dementia caregivers. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Cuidando Juntos shows promise as a culturally attuned intervention to enhance caregiver well-being among Latinos.

INTRODUCTION: Increased white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) have been reported in genetic frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in small studies, but the sequence of WMH abnormalities relative to other biomarkers is unclear. METHODS: Using a large dataset (n = 763 GENFI2 participants), we measured WMHs and examined them across genetic FTD variants and stages. Cortical and subcortical volumes were parcellated, and serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels were measured. Biomarker progression was assessed with discriminative event-based and regression modeling. RESULTS: Symptomatic GRN carriers showed elevated WMHs, primarily in the frontal lobe, while no significant increase was observed in symptomatic C9orf72 or MAPT carriers. WMH abnormalities preceded NfL elevation, ventricular enlargement, and cortical atrophy. Longitudinally, baseline WMHs predicted subcortical changes, while subcortical volumes did not predict WMH changes, suggesting WMHs may precede neurodegeneration. DISCUSSION: WMHs are elevated in a subset of GRN-associated FTD. When present, they appear early and should be considered in disease progression models. HIGHLIGHTS: Elevated WMH volumes are found predominantly in symptomatic GRN. WMH accumulation is mostly observed in the frontal lobe. WMH abnormalities appear early in GRN-associated FTD, before NfL, atrophy, and ventriculomegaly. Longitudinally, WMH volumes can predict subcortical changes, but not vice versa. WMHs are key early markers in GRN-associated FTD and should be included in progression models.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: People living with dementia see autonomy as central to their well-being, and loss of autonomy is one of the things people diagnosed with dementia fear the most. Effective support of autonomy requires us to understand carefully what autonomy is and to structure care plans and health policy in accordance with that understanding. Many recent social scientific studies of autonomy in people with dementia do not carefully operationalize the term "autonomy." This is problematic because autonomy is a highly ambiguous term that points to a complex reality. We distill from the relevant philosophical and empirical literatures a conceptually clear and empirically informed account that is relevant to the experience of people living with dementia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We present a general account of the concept of personal autonomy, drawing on existing philosophical literature. We then test the relevance of this account via a scoping review of empirical research reporting on the experience of personal autonomy in persons living with dementia. RESULTS: With the assumption that adequate relational supports are in place, all aspects of our philosophically informed account of personal autonomy (decisional autonomy, authenticity, and executional autonomy) are compatible with the experience of persons living with dementia. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: With adequate relational support, personal autonomy remains an achievable goal even in contexts of moderate to severe dementia. A conception of personal autonomy that is both theoretically and empirically informed can help guide efforts to study and support personal autonomy in persons living with dementia.

Background/Objectives: Lifestyle and socioeconomic disparities influence dementia prevalence and treatment across ethnic groups worldwide. Our study aimed to examine differences in the diagnosis, work-up, and treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well as various types of dementia provided to Arab and Jewish participants in Israel. Methods: Data were collected retrospectively and anonymously between 1 January 2010 and 12 September 2021, by Clalit Health Services' research department. Ethnicity was determined based on residence, including only cities with a 99% majority of either Jewish or Arab participants, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Subjects over the age of 60 with an MCI or dementia diagnosis were analyzed. Results: Of 212,091 diagnosed individuals, 14,742 were of a definite ethnicity as defined. The mean age at diagnosis was significantly younger for Arab participants (75.78 ± 10.28) compared to Jewish participants (80.14 ± 9.45) (p < 0.001). The gender distribution was similar (42.5% male). The most common diagnosis was Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting 2495 (29.8%) of Jewish participants and 2387 (38%) of Arab participants (p < 0.001). Vascular dementia (VD) was also more prevalent in Arab participants, 12.6%, vs. 6.42% in Jewish participants (p < 0.001). MCI was more common in Jewish participants, 26.2%, compared to 10.3% in Arab participants (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Arab participants were diagnosed with dementia at a younger age and showed higher rates of AD and VD diagnosis compared to Jewish participants, but were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with MCI. Efforts to understand and address these underlying causes are warranted to promote health equity.

OBJECTIVE: The association between core clinical features and anxiety and the neural basis of anxiety in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are unknown. Therefore, this study examined the core clinical features associated with anxiety in DLB and identified the brain regions associated with anxiety using statistical imaging analysis. METHODS: This study was conducted using a part of the data from "The Japan multicenter study: Behavioral and psychological symptoms Integrated Research in Dementia-Retrospective Neuroimaging part". Overall, 40 patients with probable DLB whose clinical dementia rating score was either 0.5 or 1 were included in this study. Anxiety was evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The incidence of each of the 4 core features was compared between patients with and without anxiety, and the brain regions associated with anxiety were examined using single-photon emission computed tomography data. RESULTS: Patients with DLB with anxiety had a significantly higher percentage of fluctuating cognition than those without anxiety. The NPI anxiety score was significantly negatively correlated with regional cerebral blood flow in the right supramarginal gyrus in patients with DLB. CONCLUSION: Anxiety in DLB is associated with fluctuating cognition. It is also likely that the brain regions associated with anxiety in DLB are potentially influenced by the neurofunctional characteristics of DLB, in which the parietal lobes are more likely to be impaired.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a dementia awareness and stigma reduction program among the Arab minoritized population in Israel. Specifically, we examined changes in knowledge, stigma, perceived susceptibility, and support sources following community-based informational sessions conducted by trained Arab student facilitators. METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was used. A pre-post design with 1349 participants was employed for the quantitative component, assessing changes in subjective and objective knowledge, stigma, perceived susceptibility, and support sources. The qualitative component included in-depth interviews with 40 student facilitators to explore their experiences and insights. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, regression analyses, and thematic content analysis. RESULTS: The findings revealed significant increases in dementia knowledge, positive emotional reactions, and use of formal support sources. However, no significant changes were observed in perceived susceptibility, negative emotional reactions, or behavioral discrimination. Qualitative findings highlighted facilitators' role in challenging misconceptions, fostering engagement, and addressing cultural barriers to dementia discussions. CONCLUSION: The program effectively enhanced dementia knowledge and encouraged community dialogue but had limited impact on deep-seated stigma. Future initiatives should incorporate sustained interventions and culturally tailored messaging to further promote dementia awareness and reduce stigma in minoritized communities.

OBJECTIVE: Diagnosing and treating dysphagia in patients with dementia is challenging and few studies have been performed to characterize dysphagia based on Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). Therefore, we aimed to characterize and compare the dysphagia pathologies in various stages and types of dementia. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 107 hospitalized geriatric patients with dysphagia and Alzheimer's dementia, Alzheimer's dementia with moderate to severe cerebral vasculopathy (mixed dementia), and patients with dementia associated with Parkinson's syndrome who underwent FEES. A standardized FEES protocol was used to characterize the dysphagia pathologies, including premature bolus spillage, delayed swallowing reflex and bolus residue as well as penetration and aspiration and the white-out intensity. The distribution of different dysphagia pathologies was cross-tabulated with χ2 statistics across different types of dementia. RESULTS: A comparative analysis of dysphagia pathologies across the three dementia types revealed a relatively mixed picture of various dysphagia findings in all dementia types. However, a significantly higher prevalence of bolus penetration and complex dysphagia, which was defined as presence of at least two major findings simultaneously within a patient, was seen in patients with Parkinson's-related dementia compared to other forms of dementia. In general, residue was the most frequent finding in all types of dementia (78%-100%). In contrast, aspiration was the least prevalent finding with no significant variation between dementia types. CONCLUSION: Although participants with Parkinson's-related dementia exhibited minor specific findings, our study revealed no distinct endoscopic dysphagia pathologies across various types of dementia.

The search for a treatment for dementia has been troubled by recent evidence of laboratory fraud. While acknowledging the seriousness of fraud, the author argues that the search for treatment has been slowed more by scientists' failure adequately to address two questions: 1) Why is dementia delayable before diagnosis yet unstoppable after diagnosis? And 2) How did molecular markers of dementia (like the peptide Aβ) evolve? What do they do for the individual, that made their evolution possible? These questions are addressed and their implications for the delay and treatment of dementia are discussed.

INTRODUCTION: Due to their cognitive challenges, individuals with dementia, often rely on their caregivers for support with activities of daily living. Many of them use dietary supplements (DS) but are at risk of overdosing on DS due to forgetfulness. Moreover, DS may cause adverse events or interactions with prescription drugs (PD). This study aimed to explore the role of caregivers in managing DS use and to identify potential risks associated with its administration. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey among caregivers of individuals with dementia recruited from dementia organisations in North-Norway. RESULTS: Out of 163 caregivers invited to participate, 104 (64%) participated. Of those, 59 reported that the individual under their care used DS. Twenty-seven caregivers had assisted in DS administration. Eleven expressed concerns around the DS use, and 17 reported that the individual with dementia had previously made mistakes in its administration. Several caregivers did not know whether the individual with dementia used DS nor had difficulties taking DS correctly. Additionally, only 45 were aware that DS use could potentially be harmful. Regarding securing safe use of DS in this patient group, the respondents ranked general practitioners to be most responsible. Nearly 50% of those who had sought advice from health care professionals regarding DS use, were not satisfied with the response. A small sample size and heterogeneous study group must be taken into account when interpreting the results. CONCLUSION: Caregivers were often involved in individuals with dementia's DS use and expressed a willingness to assume responsibility for ensuring safer use. However, several respondents were unaware of the general safety concerns related to DS use. Furthermore, communication with health care professionals regarding DS use, often failed to met the needs of these patients and their caregiver. Collectively, these conditions may impose a risk to individuals with dementia.

Assessments are available which can help to identify emergency department (ED) patients who may have dementia. Persons living with dementia (PLWD) have unique emergency care needs such as difficulties with activities of daily living and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Multiple emergency care practices have shown improved outcomes for PLWD. Communication between clinicians and PLWD requires additional attention and should include care partners and other clinicians when possible. Transitions of care from the ED for PLWD are often problematic with poor outcomes. Interventions like community paramedicine follow up may improve the transition from the ED to the community.

Psychiatric disorders have been recognized as important risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, especially dementia. The strength of association varies among different psychiatric conditions, being more pronounced in severe mental illnesses, i.e., schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Multiple mechanisms seem to underlie this association, such as high prevalence of cardiovascular and other physical morbidities, poor lifestyle choices, and accelerated aging, including 'inflammaging'. They all represent opportunities for intervention, but it is still unclear whether current therapeutic approaches for psychiatric disorders can prevent the development of dementia. Other knowledge gaps include whether the risk of dementia applies to all patients with a certain condition, or if subgroups of patients are more vulnerable than others, whether different types of dementia are linked to specific psychiatric disorders.

Common oral diseases, including periodontitis and dental caries, and their endpoint as tooth loss are controllable yet highly prevalent among adults worldwide. Cognitive decline also poses significant global public health challenges during the aging process, especially the pathological form of cognitive decline such as dementia. Dementia is irreversible and is one of the leading causes of death, disability, and dependency in the aging population. Emerging research suggests a bidirectional association between oral diseases and cognitive decline or dementia. This potential link has implications for designing better oral care plans for patients with dementia and recognizing oral diseases as modifiable risk factors for dementia prevention.This chapter provides an overview of the association between oral diseases and cognitive decline, followed by a discussion of current evidence on such associations in two directions: (1) the impact of cognitive decline or dementia on oral health and (2) the role of oral diseases as modifiable risk factors for dementia. We critically evaluate several hypotheses regarding the underlying mechanisms of this association, including (1) life-course hypothesis, (2) shared inflammation and bacterial infection mechanisms, (3) malnourishment mechanism, (4) pain pathway, and (5) sensory feedback pathway.However, the association between oral diseases and cognitive decline or dementia remains controversial due to limited high-quality evidence, particularly from biomedical research. Much of the existing evidence is from observational studies prone to confounding bias, with inconclusive questions about causation and the direction of causality.This chapter concludes by emphasizing the need for future studies with robust methodological designs, including randomized controlled trials, biomedical studies, and innovative research techniques such as Mendelian randomization. Such studies are crucial for disease prevention and enhancing patient care and quality of life. By providing a comprehensive overview, this chapter contributes to an advanced understanding of this field, addresses current study gaps, and suggests future research directions.

BACKGROUND: The global rise in dementia prevalence poses a significant public health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where resources for diagnosis, treatment, and support are constrained. Addressing this issue, the World Health Organization's 2017-2025 global action plan on dementia envisions a future where dementia is preventable, and individuals with dementia and their caregivers receive dignified support. METHODS: Using a qualitative research design, this study explores stakeholder perspectives on dementia in Colombia, framed by the World Health Organization's global action plan. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 key stakeholders from the academia, government, and the community. Data were analyzed using framework analysis. RESULTS: The interviews revealed a lack of recognition and prioritization of dementia as a public health concern in Colombia. Stakeholders expressed consensus on several challenges, including inadequate community awareness, persistent stigma, insufficient services across care levels, a lack of education for healthcare professionals, and a deficit in research characterizing the dementia population. Paradoxically, participants noted a positive trend, indicating growing awareness among both scientific and non-scientific populations. CONCLUSIONS: Dementia must urgently be recognized as a public health priority in Colombia. The identified barriers underscore the struggles faced by individuals with dementia and their families, emphasizing the critical need for increased community and governmental awareness.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia is a leading cause of disability. Physiotherapists play a crucial role in caring for people with dementia. However, previous research has found that physiotherapists have low knowledge and confidence working with people with dementia. OBJECTIVE: To determine: 1) What are the components of effective physiotherapy care for people with dementia; and 2) What can be done to facilitate the provision of effective physiotherapy care. METHODS: This was a qualitative study using an interpretive description approach. Sixteen physiotherapists experienced in dementia care participated in semi-structured interviews. Researchers analyzed data using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Two themes were created for each research objective. The themes explaining the components of effective physiotherapy care were: 1) engaging the person with dementia (subthemes: knowing the person with dementia; using knowledge to adapt the approach to successfully deliver physiotherapy treatments; optimizing the physical environment) and 2) collaborative care (subthemes: working with care partners; working as an interdisciplinary team). The themes describing how to facilitate provision of effective care were: 1) Physiotherapists require "greater opportunity for mentoring and education on dementia care" and 2) Physiotherapists must "advocate for the role of physiotherapy in dementia care." CONCLUSION: These findings provide important information regarding the components of effective dementia care for physiotherapists and will help guide clinical practice, inform future dementia education, research, and professional organization advocacy initiatives.

OBJECTIVES: NHS England publishes monthly national and regional estimated dementia diagnosis rates (DDR) to assess the healthcare system's effectiveness in identifying dementia cases. Previous research indicates that sociodemographic factors, such as ethnic minority status, socioeconomic deprivation, and rurality, influence both healthcare quality and dementia risk. This study aimed to examine the association between these sociodemographic factors and DDR, and to estimate an ethnicity-adjusted DDR using available ethnic group data. METHOD: We analysed NHS Digital Primary Care Dementia Data electronic health records for July 2023. We used a linear regression model to determine the association between DDR and ethnicity, deprivation, and rurality factors using local authority region level data. We also adjusted the DDR at the level of sub-integrated care boards based on previously published odds ratios of dementia diagnosis by ethnic group. RESULTS: Regression modelling revealed that areas with higher proportions of minority ethnic groups and greater rurality had lower DDRs. Conversely, higher levels of deprivation were linked to higher DDRs. After adjusting for different odds ratios for dementia in minority ethnic groups, the national DDR decreased by 1%, with regional diagnosis rates dropping by up to 5.4%. CONCLUSION: Higher regional proportional ethnic minority population and greater rurality were associated with a lower DDR which might reflect poorer access to diagnostic services. Higher deprivation levels were associated with a higher DDR which might reflect higher rates of dementia in more deprived populations. We discuss measures to improve the accuracy and utility of the DDR, with a specific focus on ethnicity.

BACKGROUND: The incidence and prevalence of dementia, and thus dementia-related behavioral and psychological symptoms, are increasing significantly. Currently, there are limited safe and efficacious options for treating these symptoms. Dexmedetomidine has been used for agitation related to delirium and showed significant benefit in prior studies. This raises the question whether dexmedetomidine could also provide a safe and effective treatment for BPSD, including agitation related to dementia. METHODS: Our team searched PubMed, Cochrane Database, and Ovid with the terms dexmedetomidine and dementia. Only studies published in English language journals, or with official English language translations, and human studies were included. All reports of dexmedetomidine for dementia were included regardless of study type. RESULTS: No completed studies on dexmedetomidine for agitation in dementia were identified. The TRANQUILITY study is in progress, although results are yet to be published. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine has shown benefit for hospital delirium and for agitation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. However, there are no completed studies published on dexmedetomidine for agitation in dementia. Controlled studies with larger sample sizes are needed to assess the efficacy, safety, and the best route of administration for this drug in managing BPSD including agitation.

Vascular dementia (VaD) is recognized as the second most prevalent form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, with its pathogenesis intricately associated with cerebrovascular pathologies, including chronic hypoperfusion, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Recent studies have highlighted dysregulated iron metabolism as a pivotal factor in the pathogenesis of VaD; however, the precise mechanisms and therapeutic implications of this dysregulation remain insufficiently elucidated. In this article, we synthesize clinical and basic research to systematically explore the interaction between iron metabolism and VaD. Aberrant iron metabolism contributes to neuronal damage by exacerbating oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis, while cerebrovascular injuries, such as blood-brain barrier disruption and chronic inflammation, further compromise iron metabolism, thereby perpetuating a detrimental cycle. From a diagnostic standpoint, imaging modalities such as susceptibility-weighted imaging, alongside biomarkers like ferritin and soluble transferrin receptors, serve as effective instruments for detecting iron-related pathologies in VaD. At the therapeutic level, the use of chelating agents such as deferoxamine and deferiprone, in combination with antioxidants and innovative nanomaterials, has exhibited neuroprotective effects in animal models by alleviating iron-induced oxidative damage. Nevertheless, further validation is required to establish their clinical efficacy and safety. This is a narrative review. This article investigates the influence and significance of iron metabolism in the pathophysiology of VaD and explores potential therapeutic targets associated with iron metabolism, offering implications for future clinical applications.

BACKGROUND: Caregivers often lack access to comprehensive information on young-onset dementia (YOD), leaving them unprepared for their caregiving roles. Especially, spousal caregivers of people with (YOD) face challenges, balancing caregiving with work and personal responsibilities in everyday life. However, their specific needs remain underexplored. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to identify and map the lived experiences and unmet needs of spousal caregivers of persons with YOD. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted across several databases (Embase, Scopus, Academic Search Premier, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL Ultimate, and PubMed via EBSCOhost), including MEDLINE to identify studies on spousal caregivers of people with YOD. Articles were screened and selected based on inclusion criteria, and key data were extracted and categorised into themes that captured the lived experiences and unmet needs of this caregiver population. FINDINGS: The review identified five overarching themes related to the needs of spousal caregivers of people with YOD: psychoeducational, social support, practical support, emotional and psychological support, and navigational support needs. Caregivers often lack access to comprehensive information on YOD, leaving them unprepared for their caregiving roles. Social isolation, financial burdens, and role conflicts were common experiences. Emotional distress, identity loss, and lack of recognition for caregiving efforts contributed to psychological strain. Moreover, caregivers encountered significant challenges in accessing and coordinating healthcare services, often having to advocate for appropriate support. The need for tailored services, respite care, financial and legal guidance, and professional counselling was strongly emphasised. CONCLUSION: This scoping review identified a wide range of unmet needs among spousal caregivers of persons with YOD, underscoring the need for psychoeducational, social, practical, emotional, and navigational support. The findings revealed gaps in current support systems across personal, social, and systemic levels, emphasising the complex and disruptive nature of the caregiving experience. Future interventions should prioritise accessible, comprehensive, and tailored support services to effectively address these unique caregiving challenges.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is a syndrome characterised by progressive cognitive and functional decline arising from a neurodegenerative disease. Genetic testing, imaging and fluid biomarkers mean that levels of risk of dementia diagnosis are becoming frequent and complex. How risk is communicated in this context is an increasingly important topic. AIMS: The aim of this scoping review is to map the existing literature regarding the components of risk communication, the factors influencing its outcomes and the guidelines developed to support clinicians in this process. METHODS: This is a systematic scoping review addressing the communication of risk to individuals living with or at risk of dementia, as well as perspectives of family, carers and healthcare professionals. RESULTS: 115 articles were identified, including genetic (n=41), amyloid (n=45) and other biomarkers (n=9). Patients expressed a desire to be informed about their risk of developing dementia, listing future planning and participation in clinical research as benefits of disclosure. While risk disclosure did not significantly impact anxiety or depression, it was associated with increased event distress among participants identified as elevated risk. Individuals at high risk frequently overestimated their likelihood of developing dementia. Tools and guidelines that have supported clinicians in risk disclosure emphasised the use of educational materials, clear communication about risk and prognosis, and regular follow-up appointments. Gaps in literature include blood biomarkers, non-Alzheimer's disease dementias and communication to people with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Risk communication is a crucial topic for healthcare professionals, especially since the emergence of novel techniques to predict dementia.

Atrial Fibrillation, dementia, and obesity are prevalent and interconnected pathologic states with significant morbidity and mortality and increasing global incidence. This review examines the current literature regarding the known and hypothesized relationships between these three conditions, their risk factors, and treatment strategies. We aim to highlight a stepwise and potentially causative interplay between them. As all three states become increasingly common in clinical practice, a detailed understanding of their multifactorial and multimodal relationship becomes critical for effective multidisciplinary care. Appropriate treatment of each is likely to reduce the burden of all three.

We report a case of young-onset dementia (YOD) in a 40-year-old male with a heterozygous missense variant in the PDGFRβ gene. The patient exhibited progressive memory decline and disorientation. Brain MRI and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers were consistent with Alzheimer's disease. Whole-exome sequencing identified a likely pathogenic PDGFRB c.1316G > A (p.Arg439Gln) variant. This report highlights a novel potential genetic contributor to vascular dysfunction and cognitive decline.

AIMS AND METHOD: Non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) are recognised for their potential in treating dementia symptoms. However, little is known about the extent of their use. In this study, we conducted structured interviews with people with dementia and their family caregivers (n = 50), professional caregivers (n = 42) and dementia care coordinators (n = 42) on the use of 14 NPIs. RESULTS: Cognitive stimulation/training, physical activity and occupational therapy were implemented by most participants, whereas neurofeedback, drama therapy and phototherapy were rarely used. Most NPIs were carried out weekly. People with dementia and their caregivers reported using significantly fewer NPIs than other participants (P < 0.001). Participants perceived effects for, on average, 90.3% (s.d. = 31.3%) of the NPIs that they used. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Providing targeted support and funding might help to increase the use of NPIs by family caregivers as well as in institutional care settings.

Dementia, marked by cognitive decline, significantly impacts daily life. With global prevalence rising, traditional treatments manage symptoms but have side effects and offer no cure. Non-pharmacological interventions, like serious games, are gaining importance. This study assesses the feasibility and benefits of serious games for people with mild to moderate dementia over a 10-week intervention. Sixty-one patients were recruited, with 35 completing the study. The intervention included six games focusing on physical and cognitive training. Outcome measures were motor function, cognitive assessments, quality of life, and depression. Results showed significant improvements in dynamic balance (p = .013) but no significant changes in other measures. The findings suggest that serious games are feasible and can improve motor functions like balance. However, short intervention periods may limit their impact on cognitive function and quality of life. Longer interventions and personalized game designs are recommended for greater benefits.

Up-to-date, strictly cross-nationally comparable and nationally representative data on cognitive health are essential for our understanding of the dementia-related challenges in healthcare, to detect shortcomings in healthcare systems and to design effective prevention strategies. Such data have been missing in Europe. We use the most recent 2022 wave of the strictly harmonized Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE, 47,773 individuals age 65 and older) to obtain prevalence estimates of mild cognitive impairment and dementia for 27 European countries and Israel in 2022. The novelty of the paper is to validate these estimates using the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) as a validation tool. These new data exhibit much higher prevalence rates of dementia in the Mediterranean and Southeastern European countries and a much larger variation of cognitive impairment across Europe and Israel than previously known. Dementia prevalence ranges from 4.5% in Switzerland to 22.7% in Spain, MCI prevalence from 17.2% in Sweden to 31.1% in Portugal. Most of this variation can be explained by differences in education when respondents were young. Prevalence rates vary plausibly with other risk factors such as age and comorbidities associated with dementia.

As the population ages, the anticipated rates of dementia worldwide are likely to increase dramatically, especially in low- and middle-income countries; thus, any opportunity to modify dementia risk is especially critical. Hypertension is one risk factor that is highly prevalent, consistently important for late-life brain health, and which could represent a target for prevention of dementia. Furthermore, hypertension is the most significant modifiable risk factor for stroke. This review will summarize existing literature linking hypertension with dementia and brain health more broadly, will discuss potential mechanisms linking hypertension with brain health, and will consider specific factors that may impact not only the relationship between hypertension and the brain but also the importance of treatment, including different associations over the life course.

In this paper, we engage in philosophical inquiry to consider the relevance of Indigenous Knowledges (IKs) for reimagining dementia care for individuals living with dementia. We outline the limitations of philosophical perspectives aligned with Eurocentric academic knowledge, arguing that such knowledge relies on an individualistic view of self and neglects the body and embodied experience in dementia care. We demonstrate how a personal diachronicity perspective diminishes the importance of valuing the fluid and dynamic self-identities of persons living with dementia. We then turn to the epistemological foundations of IKs through philosophical inquiry, focusing on relationality, connectiveness, and holism, and discuss the role of IKs in institutional knowledge systems. We then explore the potential relevance of IKs to widen the epistemological and ontological gaze centering on the relational concepts of personhood, holism, continuity, embodiment, and homogeneity of self that are foundational to reimaging dominant approaches to dementia care.

Cerebrovascular thrombosis is among the most critical medical conditions, making early diagnosis and management crucial. Although some symptoms of cerebrovascular thrombosis are typical and lead to early diagnosis, they can sometimes present with rare and unusual symptoms, complicating the diagnostic process. Given the morbidity and mortality associated with these events, it is important to be aware of unexpected symptoms to diagnose and manage these patients more accurately and rapidly. We report a 74-year-old female initially misdiagnosed with Alzheimer's because of cognitive decline and disorganized speech. Her symptoms did not improve with Alzheimer's treatment. She was reevaluated by a neurologist, and her cognitive test results were impaired. Her brain MRI revealed a previously undetected left transverse sinus cerebral venous thrombosis with subcortical white matter lesions. The patient was managed acutely with subcutaneous enoxaparin and transitioned to oral rivaroxaban, resulting in significant improvement. This case report aimed to draw attention to the pitfalls of diagnosing dementia-like syndromes in the elderly, advocating for a systematic approach to differential diagnosis. It emphasizes that a collaborative effort between psychiatrists, neurologists, radiologists, and other healthcare members is essential for accurate diagnosis and timely intervention, which can significantly alter the management and outcome for the patient.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), a common cause of dementia, has no FDA-approved therapies, and clinical trials to date have had limited ability to demonstrate efficacy. The lack of validated DLB-specific clinical trial outcomes may hinder these efforts. Here, we test whether the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and other commonly used clinical evaluation tools for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) could potentially be used as outcome measures in future DLB clinical trials. METHODS: A retrospective, cross-sectional chart review of 600 patients (359 AD, 241 DLB) who completed a comprehensive clinical, cognitive, functional, and behavioral evaluation over a 10-year period was carried out. Performance of the CDR, its sum of boxes (CDR-SB), and other AD and PD evaluation measures were assessed for stage-wide performance from mild cognitive impairment (CDR 0.5) to moderate-severe dementia (CDR 2). RESULTS: The CDR and CDR-SB characterize important differences between AD and DLB across different cross-sectional stages of disease severity, with the greatest differences seen at the CDR 0.5 stage. DLB showed greater deficits in commonly used AD functional and behavioral measures at the CDR 0.5 stage, while more DLB-specific measures showed significant differences from AD across the entire disease spectrum. The patient version of the Quick Dementia Rating System showed greater stage-wide impairment in DLB than AD, supporting its use as a patient-reported outcome. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment showed greater stage-wide impairment in AD than in DLB patients, suggesting lack of sensitivity as an outcome measure for DLB clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Improved study design and selection of appropriate outcome measures in DLB clinical trials can facilitate demonstration of efficacy. While the CDR-SB could work on a DLB clinical trial, the field would be most advanced by the development of a DLB-specific global rating instrument.

INTRODUCTION: Recovery Colleges (RC/RCs) aim to promote personal recovery through co-produced courses, grounded in the CHIME (Connectedness, Hope, Identity, Meaning, Empowerment) framework. The DiSCOVERY research programme noted that RC dementia courses may offer a person-centred approach to post-diagnostic dementia care. However, the lack of validated outcome measures for this context presents a challenge in evaluating RCs' effectiveness. This scoping review examines the potential outcome measures for evaluating the impact of RC dementia courses. METHODS: The review followed the Arksey and O'Malley framework, searching for eligible papers across six databases related to dementia and the CHIME strengths-based approach. Instruments relating to personal recovery and positive psychology for people with dementia or their family supporters were included. Measures of cognition, clinical symptoms, or 'negative constructs' (e.g., burden) were excluded. DiSCOVERY stakeholder groups (people with dementia and clinicians) met to collaboratively identify meaningful domains and relevant measures. RESULTS: Fourteen instruments relating to hope, resilience, self-efficacy, empowerment, and coping were identified. Stakeholders of people living with dementia endorsed domains of empowerment, resilience, and hope. No single instrument captured the range of outcomes that underlie the concepts of the RC dementia course. DISCUSSION: This study contributes to the limited literature on instruments for the evaluation of concepts underlying RC dementia courses. Findings suggest a need for adaptation and further validation of existing measures, to address responsiveness, interpretability, and the inclusion of domains related to recovery. Future research on recovery in the context of dementia should involve developing or adapting new measures, conducting feasibility studies, and exploring cultural sensitivity for diverse populations.

BACKGROUND: Many types of dementia have high heritability, which creates opportunities for DNA diagnostics. Clinicians sporadically test for causal genetic variants. However, in addition to causal genetic mutations, an increasing number of both common and rare risk factors are being identified, especially for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we describe and evaluate diagnostic performance of combining genetic risk factors for AD to assist memory clinic clinicians. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 998 consecutive patients (mean age 62.1, 40.3% females, 63.3% dementia) was conducted over 2.5 years in a Dutch memory clinic. The patients underwent a complete genetic risk assessment, including whole-exome sequencing and array genotyping. We examined known pathogenic genetic variants for all dementia types and their correlation with clinical diagnoses. We evaluated a combined genetic score (GS) based on all genetic risk factors for AD - namely APOE genotypes, candidate risk rare variants in 11 genes, and a polygenic risk score (PRS) based on 82 common variants. Then, we analyzed the discriminatory characteristics of the GS. RESULTS: Causal pathogenic variants were rare, present in 3.4% of individuals, but genetic testing would have altered the diagnosis in over half of the carriers. Candidate rare risk variants were more common, identified in 31.6% of patients. Both APOE genotypes and the PRS were independently associated with AD, and gene-specific interaction was found between TREM2 and AD-PRS (β = -1.16, p = 0.015). Patients with a high GS were 7 times more likely receive an AD diagnosis compared to those with a low GS (p = 2.5E-07). CONCLUSION: Overall, this study highlights the potential of integrating genetic risk factors into clinical practice to enhance AD diagnosis, though the improvement in diagnostic accuracy was moderate. The findings underscore the importance of genetic testing in diagnosis while also recognizing its limitations.

BACKGROUND: Family members are often the primary caregivers for individuals with dementia, but they face significant challenges in navigating health care and social services, especially as the disease progresses. Many caregivers experience loneliness, social isolation, and stress from sacrificing their own well-being. This study aimed to describe the daily experiences of family caregivers of individuals with dementia, with the objective of better understanding and addressing their specific needs. METHODS: Qualitative interviews with 11 family caregivers in Sweden. Data were analyzed by inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: (1) Struggling with conflicting emotions and social challenges - caregivers reported experiencing stress, physical exhaustion, and emotional strain due to constant availability and the challenges of managing behavioral changes, further intensified by isolation and shrinking social networks. (2) Balancing autonomy in care decisions - caregivers described the paradox of bearing full responsibility for care decisions despite having limited access to information, and, (3) Dependence on home care and nursing homes that are not adapted to needs - caregivers expressed a reliance on home care and nursing homes, yet noted that these services are often ill-equipped to address the specific demands of dementia care. CONCLUSION: Caring for a family member with dementia reshapes family roles and creates ongoing challenges in balancing safety, well-being, and limited support. This study highlights the need for person- and family-centered care, grounded in the home context and developed in partnership with family caregivers. Improved coordination, trained staff, and supportive policies are essential, alongside continued conceptual development to define best practices in dementia care.

Dementia is one of the world's greatest public health challenges. An increasing number of studies point to contact with nature in the form of green views and stays in green environments as a non-pharmacological way of supporting the well-being of persons with dementia. This article introduces the Nature Support Model for Dementia, a conceptual idea that can be used to design green environments at nursing homes for people with dementia intended to support the user's health and well-being. The model is evidence-based and reposes on studies on user specific design of green environments. Furthermore, it builds on existing conceptual models for the design of supportive green environments. It caters to nursing home residents in the final stages of dementia decline. It considers their increasing needs for assistance and meets the needs for safety and security. The model was developed in connection with an evidence-based design process resulting in an architectural proposal for a nursing home. A presentation of this proposal illustrates how the model can be used in practice to facilitate architectural programming and the design of green nursing home environments intended to be supportive.

INTRODUCTION: Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) pose significant challenges for individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Agitation symptoms, in particular, present a complex management dilemma as there is a lack of consensus regarding pharmacotherapy, specifically with respect to the controversial use of valproate formulations. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of valproate treatment in addressing BPSD, with a specific focus on managing agitation symptoms in individuals with dementia. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) on patients diagnosed with BPSD who received valproate formulations between 2013 and 2023. Patients were classified into 'effective,' 'ineffective,' and 'unknown' groups based on their response to valproate treatment, and the distribution of BPSD symptoms between the effective and ineffective groups was compared. RESULTS: Among the 116 patients studied, 62.1% exhibited effective responses, 12.1% showed ineffectiveness, and 25.9% had uncertain outcomes with valproate therapy. While the effective group displayed a higher prevalence of agitation symptoms and other behaviors like wandering, restricted and repetitive behaviors, and sleep disturbances compared to the ineffective group, these differences did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.156, 1.000, 0.899, 0.283). Patients in the ineffective group were more likely to experience aggression with comorbid psychotic symptoms compared to those in the effective group (p = 0.023). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that tailored valproate treatment at low doses may be beneficial in managing agitation without psychosis in Asian BPSD patients. Further validation through randomized controlled trials is essential to substantiate these observations.

Objective: Due to similarities in cognitive impairments shown in early states of dementia (DEM) and depression (DEP), accurate differentiation between the two in elderly remains challenging in clinical practice. Using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in addition to the gold standard of neuropsychological assessment could help the differentiation between healthy controls (HC) and DEM, as well as between DEM and DEP by providing a diagnostic rule for clinicians. Methods: We used four different ML algorithms (SVM: Support Vector Machine, NB: Gaussian Naïve Bayes, RF: Random Forest, GLMnet: Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized Generalized Linear Models) and logistic regression (LR) to differentiate between HC (n = 407), patients with DEM (n = 131) and patients with DEP (n = 145) using features from the tablet-based neuropsychological test battery Cognitive Functions Dementia (CFD). We also investigated whether the type of input data (i.e. raw scores vs. sociodemographically adjusted raw scores or T-scores) influences the classification accuracy. Results: Using raw data from the CFD and the GLMnet algorithm, we could accurately differentiate between DEM vs. HC with accuracies ranging up to 94.0%. Similarly, we could classify DEM and DEP with accuracies up to 80.8% using the Naïve Bayes algorithm and raw scores. Measures for verbal memory, word fluency and processing speed showed the highest feature importance within these classifications, highlighting their importance for differential diagnosis. Conclusions: We provide preliminary evidence that ML algorithms in combination with the CFD can aid clinicians in the differential diagnosis of HC and DEM, as well as DEM and DEP by providing a decision-making aid.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is a syndrome characterized by a wide spectrum of symptoms and needs. There is no cure for this syndrome, which represents a major challenge to society in terms of quality of life for those affected and in terms of workload and stress burden for those who take care of them. OBJECTIVE: The Healthy Ageing Ecosystem for People With Dementia (HAAL) aimed to improve the quality of life of both people with dementia and their formal caregivers (FCs) and informal caregivers (ICs) by providing a personalized set of devices to the person with dementia, along with a dashboard designed for caregivers to monitor and manage the older person. METHODS: The HAAL platform comprises a dashboard that integrates, aggregates, and analyzes heterogeneous data gathered from an ecosystem of devices designed for and tested with people with dementia. The study was designed as a technical feasibility pilot to test the HAAL ecosystem in 3 countries: Italy, Taiwan, and the Netherlands, where older people with initial, moderate, and severe dementia were enrolled, respectively. The study was run in 2 stages: the alpha and beta pilot studies aimed to test the second and third prototypes of the platform, respectively. RESULTS: The alpha test was conducted from March to May 2023, involving 41 end users, of which 13 were people with dementia, 13 were ICs, and 15 were FCs. The beta test was conducted from September 2023 to February 2024, involving 83 end users, of which 26 were people with dementia, 20 were ICs, and 37 were FCs. The results have been elaborated and are supposed to be published by 2026. CONCLUSIONS: The HAAL pilot study was an innovative feasibility study whose primary objectives were to assess reduction in care load for FCs, stress relief for FCs and ICs, and improvement in the perceived quality of life for ICs and people with dementia. The study also evaluated the usability and the acceptance of the platform. Preliminary analyses of the results showed that the HAAL platform partially relieved caregivers' stress and that the quality of life of people with dementia did not worsen over the test period.

We examine the efficacy of the Individualized Coordination and Empowerment for Care Partners of Persons with Dementia (ICECaP), an intervention that involves one-on-one individualized support from a dementia care coordinator for a dementia care partner, compared to an active control group. At least once monthly contact is made from a dementia care coordinator to the dementia care partner by telephone, video conferencing, email, or in-person support at clinical visits for the person with dementia. In this pilot randomized unblinded control trial of ICECaP, n = 61 (n = 90 randomized) care partners completed 12-months of the ICECaP intervention and n = 69 (n = 92 randomized) care partners received routine clinical support (controls) in an outpatient memory care clinic at an academic medical center, from which the participants were recruited. Early termination endpoints (death and higher level of care) and trial drop out were comparable across groups. Primary efficacy outcomes were evaluated by comparing changes in care partner mental health, burden, and quality of life from baseline to 12-months between ICECaP and controls. Linear mixed-effects model with covariate adjustment revealed no significant group differences in longitudinal changes on measures of caregiving burden, care partner depression, anxiety, quality of life, or reactions to the behavioral symptoms of the person with dementia. Hypothesized reasons for lack of initial efficacy on primary 12-month outcomes are discussed.

We reviewed studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography to characterise white matter changes in Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD). The search included MEDLINE and EMBASE, and we used a narrative strategy to synthesise the evidence. Data was extracted from 57 studies, of which the majority were considered 'good quality'. Subjects with DLB and PDD had widespread white matter changes compared to healthy controls and Parkinson's disease without cognitive impairment, with a relative sparing of the hippocampus. Compared to subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), DLB had greater changes in thalamic connectivity and in the nigroputaminal tract, while AD had greater changes in the parahippocampal white matter and fornix. Cognition was associated with widespread white matter changes, visual hallucinations with thalamic and cholinergic connectivity, and parkinsonism with changes in structures involved in motor control. DTI and tractography may therefore be well suited for discriminating DLB and PDD from other types of dementia, and for studying the aetiology of common symptoms.

Background: Dementia does not merely affect individuals, the carer and the person living with dementia, but also has a profound impact on their spousal relationship. As such, this study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of how dementia affects spousal relationships with a focus on interpersonal (i.e. relationship adjustment, communication engagement and emotional connection between two individuals) and intrapersonal (i.e. loss of self within the context of relationships) dynamics using a qualitative approach. The study also explored how carers adapt to such relationship challenges in the context of dementia care.Methods: A phenomenological approach was used to capture the subjective experiences of female spousal carers, who regularly support their partner living with dementia. A total of nine semi-structured interviews were conducted.Results: Relationship adjustment theme highlighted how learning to acknowledge role shifts from a spouse to a carer is critical for carers to manage relationship difficulties. Emotional connection theme demonstrated the importance of reminiscing about the shared history between dyads to cope with feelings of loss of affective intimacy. Communication engagement theme revealed carers' need to learn a new way of communicating due to the decrease in meaningful communication and two-way interaction. Sense of self theme highlighted the importance of self-compassion to overcome feelings of self-loss and isolation.Conclusion: Findings suggest that improving the relationship between female spousal carers and their partner living with dementia may require targeted interventions addressing different factors. Such interventions can include a couple's life story approach to enable couples to reminisce about their shared experiences, interactive communication training to enhance meaningful engagements, and a psychological approach such as compassion-focused therapy to overcome emotional challenges and facilitate self-compassion.

The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems version 11 (ICD-11) represents a conceptual advance over ICD-10 in the classification of dementias. Although the syndromic classification in the chapter "Neurocognitive disorders" remains in principle unchanged, the introduction of severity levels and the central positioning of mental and behavioral symptoms enables a more precise coding of the clinical diagnoses. Furthermore, the introduction of mild neurocognitive disorder as a prodromal state of dementia is new. The clinical criteria developed by international experts, e.g., for frontotemporal dementia or Lewy body disease, are not yet sufficiently included in ICD-11. Biomarkers for the etiological diagnostics of dementia are also not mentioned, so that it is unclear which role they play in the disease classification in ICD-11. Due to the rapid development in the field of neurodegenerative diseases, regular updates would be desirable.

Familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a genetically heterogeneous disease with various clinical manifestations, making it difficult to diagnose. There are three main gene mutations in familial FTD: repeat expansion in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72), microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), and progranulin (GRN). These mutations can produce corresponding changes in fluid biomarkers years before symptoms appear. Therefore, biomarkers play a vital role in the diagnosis and treatment of familial FTD. In this review, we highlight fluid biomarkers in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that contribute to the clinical diagnosis of familial FTD, the study of disease pathophysiological mechanisms, and possibly be used as outcome endpoints in future clinical trials.

Masticatory dysfunction is a risk factor for Alzheimer 's disease (AD), likely due to the trigeminal influences on the Locus Coeruleus (LC), a structure implicated in neurodegenerative processes and whose activity level is reflected by pupil size. Chewing activity acutely stimulates cognitive performance by increasing LC activation during task, as reflected by an increased pupil dilatation (mydriasis). The presence of a trigeminal sensorimotor imbalance is associated to an asymmetry in LC activity (reflected by an asymmetry in pupil size) and is detrimental for performance. These observations prompt for developing testing procedure, in normal elders and in patients affected by AD, aimed to: 1) study the presence of trigeminal asymmetries and to assess the possible contribution of occlusal correction in improving the subject's condition and in preventing/delaying the AD development; 2) verify the stimulating effect of chewing on cognitive performance and task-related mydriasis as an estimate of the LC excitability for determining the subject condition and its susceptibility to undergo AD development. Procedures appropriate for achieving these goals are proposed.

Depression is closely associated with dementia and may serve as a risk factor, an early symptom, or a prodromal feature, particularly in Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. It can also emerge during disease progression, not only in Alzheimer's but in other dementias such as vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Recognizing the timing and context of depressive symptoms is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management. While non-pharmacological interventions and psychosocial approaches are generally recommended as the first line of treatment, clinical practice often sees widespread use of antidepressants in this vulnerable population. However, such usage is not always supported by robust evidence, particularly given the heightened risk of side effects in older adults with cognitive decline. This narrative review seeks to critically examine the role of antidepressants in managing depression among patients with dementia. Rather than dismissing their use outright, we aim to provide a novel perspective on their application, emphasizing the importance of a thorough multidimensional geriatric assessment. The attempt is to help the clinicians in making more individualized, evidence-based decisions that balance the potential benefits and risks, ensuring that treatment is tailored to the unique needs of each patient.

INTRODUCTION: Research on dementia caregiving in Africa often prioritizes biomedical and formal health-care services, overlooking broader family and community-based support networks. Addressing this gap, this study explores when and which support services Yoruba families use and how these services shape their caregiving experiences within the dementia care context. METHODS: Guided by interpretive phenomenology and Afrocentric principles, we conducted 15 semi-structured family interviews with 52 participants (2-5 per family), alongside persons with dementia. Interviews were audio-recorded, translated, and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Help seeking often began when behavioral symptoms became overwhelming. Urban families (n = 11) leaned on hospital services, while rural families (n = 4) turned to faith-based and traditional healers. Support was appreciated for offering reassurance, though hospital services often lacked cultural sensitivity, and traditional options-while fostering hope-could reinforce stigma. DISCUSSION: Enhancing dementia awareness and collaboration between medical, spiritual, and traditional systems may improve caregiver experiences and encourage earlier, culturally appropriate interventions. HIGHLIGHTS: Yoruba families caring for loved ones with dementia do not adhere to rigid care pathways. Instead, they move fluidly between hospitals, religious spaces, and traditional healing practices-not just in search of treatment but to find meaning, reassurance, and continuity with ancestral ways of knowing. Memory loss is not always seen as a medical condition; it is often interpreted through spiritual, cultural, and communal lenses. Families may turn to faith leaders or elders first, delaying formal care until behaviors become disruptive or socially visible. Our interpretive phenomenological analysis, grounded in an Afrocentric lens, reveals caregiving as both an expression of love and a weighty responsibility. The ever-present fear of judgment-from within and outside the family-can lead to silence, isolation, and hesitation in seeking biomedical support. A more compassionate and culturally anchored dementia care model requires health-care professionals, traditional healers, and faith leaders to work together. Through dialogue and mutual respect, they can create care networks that honor Yoruba worldviews, allowing families to navigate dementia in ways that feel both medically sound and spiritually resonant.

The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is related to a variety of social misbehaviors, including criminal behavior (CB) due to deep changes in cognition, behavior, and personality. Recent work suggests that impairment in emotional processing, along with disinhibition, constitutes the necessary elements for CB in bvFTD. However, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are still unclear. Therefore, we aim at investigating structural and functional brain changes related to CB in bvFTD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the German Consortium for Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD). Our study comprised 87 patients with bvFTD and 26 healthy controls recruited within different locations of the FTLD Consortium. A subset of 21 patients with bvFTD showed CB, including theft, physical violence, sexual assault, drug abuse, and violations against traffic law. Voxel-based morphometry was performed, generating gray matter density (GMD) images obtained from high-resolution T1-weighted MR images. In addition, surface-based morphometry was performed by reconstruction of cortical thickness using a projection-based thickness approach. Both GMD and cortical thickness were further analyzed in order to detect group differences between bvFTD with and without CB. Resting-state functional MRI was available for a subgroup of 56 patients with bvFTD, including 16 patients showing CB. On a behavioral level, CB in bvFTD was associated with a higher frequency of disinhibition, lower frequency of apathy, and better performance in verbal fluency. Comparing bvFTD with and without CB, we obtained reduced GMD and reduced cortical thickness in the temporal lobe, predominantly in the left hemisphere. Impairment in brain structure was correlated with the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale, particularly with disinhibition, in the left superior temporal gyrus in interaction with CB in bvFTD. Investigating functional MRI data, CB was associated with significant functional brain dysconnectivity, particularly between the left anterior superior temporal gyrus and widely distributed cortical regions, including areas in the vicinity of the precentral sulcus and the inferior frontal junction, related to executive functions. Our study revealed structural and functional brain differences between bvFTD with and without CB, showing CB-related reduced GMD and cortical thickness in the left temporal lobe, indicating disinhibition as the main driver for CB. Interestingly, brain degeneration in the temporal lobe is discussed with CB in bvFTD in the current literature, dominantly affecting the right hemisphere. Our study investigates specifically the neural correlates of CB in bvFTD with MRI, modifying this view. Further work is necessary to shed more light on the role of the temporal lobe in bvFTD with CB.

Piracetam is a cyclic derivative of gamma aminobutyric acid, has a neuroprotective effect against neurodegenerative disease by inhibiting neuroinflammation. Piracetam augments the effect of acetylcholine on the muscarinic receptors thereby improving learning and memory. In addition, piracetam through modulation of ion channels increases the activity of different neurotransmitters involved in cognitive function. Excitingly, piracetam improves blood flow by increasing erythrocyte deformability and reducing adhesion of erythrocytes to the vascular endothelium by inhibiting fibrinogen; thus, it improves microcirculation and can be used in the management of vascular dementia (VaD). Also, piracetam improves cognitive function in VaD by reducing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Hence, piracetam has a neuroprotective effect against VaD. However, the exact neuroprotective mechanism of piracetam against the development and progression of VaD was not fully clarified. Consequently, this review attempts to discuss the potential effect of piracetam in VaD.

This study aims to explore articulations of gender identity, sexuality, and LGBTI perspectives in national as well as local dementia care policies and guidelines in Sweden. The analysis of the documents is influenced by Bacchi's WPR-approach. The analysis illustrates how there is a general silence on gender identity, sexuality, and LGBTI perspectives in policy. LGBTI perspectives tend to be addressed separately from people with dementia and most often present as potential grounds for discrimination. LGBTI people with dementia appear to be non-existent, and gender identity and sexuality irrelevant to dementia care and person-centered approaches, and by extension irrelevant to personhood.

IMPORTANCE: A timely diagnosis is crucial in ensuring high-quality care for individuals with dementia. Comparing age and health status at the time of dementia diagnosis across population subgroups can provide insights into vulnerable groups that may experience delayed diagnosis and/or a poorer prognosis. OBJECTIVE: To examine how age and health at the time of dementia diagnosis vary across sociodemographic subgroups. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A nationwide cross-sectional study of individuals with an incident dementia diagnosis from either specialist care or who were dispensed antidementia drugs, identified from the Swedish National Patient Register and the Prescribed Drug Register between January 2018 and December 2022. EXPOSURES: Sociodemographic status at the time of dementia diagnosis was assessed through linkage with national registers and included education, place of birth, living arrangement, family status, and family disposable income. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Health status was assessed by calculating the number of dispensed medications during the year preceding dementia diagnosis, as well as the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) using specialist diagnoses during the preceding 5 years. RESULTS: Of the 107 707 individuals with a dementia diagnosis, 61 127 (56.8%) were women and the mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 82.0 (7.7) years. Individuals with lower education, living alone or in a care home, or without a close relative were a mean (SD) of 3.1 (7.3) years older when diagnosed with dementia compared with their counterparts. At the time of diagnosis, individuals who had lower than high school education had higher CCI (odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07-1.15) and more medications (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.33-1.44) compared with those with university education. Age and health status at dementia diagnosis did not differ significantly by place of birth or income. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This nationwide register-based study indicated that clinical diagnosis of dementia may be significantly delayed among individuals with low education, those living alone or in a care home, or those without a close relative. These groups also had poorer health at the time of dementia diagnosis, which may impact their prognosis negatively. Future efforts should focus on improving health services to better address the diagnostic and care needs of these vulnerable subgroups.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for treatment of dementia, focusing on cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other types of dementia. METHODS: Using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes (PICO) framework, we developed key clinical questions and conducted systematic literature reviews. A multidisciplinary panel of experts, organized by the Korean Dementia Association, evaluated randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Recommendations were graded for evidence quality and strength using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. RESULTS: Three main recommendations are presented: (1) For AD, cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) are strongly recommended for improving cognition and daily function based on moderate evidence; (2) Cholinesterase inhibitors are conditionally recommended for vascular dementia and Parkinson's disease dementia, with a strong recommendation for Lewy body dementia; (3) For moderate to severe AD, NMDA receptor antagonist (memantine) is strongly recommended, demonstrating significant cognitive and functional improvements. Both drug classes showed favorable safety profiles with manageable side effects. CONCLUSIONS: This guideline offers standardized, evidence-based pharmacologic recommendations for dementia management, with specific guidance on cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists. It aims to support clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes in dementia care. Further updates will address emerging treatments, including amyloid-targeting therapies, to reflect advances in dementia management.

Compensation has been proposed as a mechanism to explain how individuals in very old age remain able to maintain normal cognitive functioning. Previous studies have provided evidence on the role of increasing functional connectivity as a compensatory mechanism for age-related white matter damage. However, we lack direct investigation into how these mechanisms contribute to the preservation of cognition in the very old population. We examined a cohort of near-centenarians and centenarians without dementia (aged 95-103 years, n=44). We constructed a structural disconnection matrix based on the disruption of white matter pathways caused by white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), aiming to explore the relationship between functional connections, cognitive preservation and white matter damage. Our results revealed that structural damage can reliably explain the variations of functional connections or cognitive maintenance. Notably, we found significant correlations between the weights in the functional connectivity model and the weights in the cognition model. We observed positive correlations between models for brain disconnections and cognitive function in near-centenarians and centenarians. The strongest effects were found between attention and somatomotor network (SMN) (r=0.397, p<0.001), memory and SMN (r=0.333 p<0.001), fluency and visual network (VIS) - control network (CN) (r=0.406, p<0.001), language and VIS (r=0.309, p<0.001), visuospatial ability and VIS-default mode network (DMN) (r=0.464, p<0.001), as well as global cognition and VIS-DMN (r=0.335, p<0.001). These findings suggest that enhancement of functional connectivity may serve as a compensatory mechanism, such that it mitigates the effects of white matter damage and contributes to preserved cognitive performance in very old age.

INTRODUCTION: Informal care estimates for use in health-economic models are lacking. We aimed to estimate the association between informal care time and dementia symptoms across Europe. METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed on 13,529 observations in 5,369 persons from 9 European pooled cohort or trial studies in community-dwelling persons with dementia. A mixed regression model was fitted to time spent on instrumental or basic activities of daily living using disease severity and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Daily informal care time was 0.5 hours higher in moderate compared to mild and 1.3h higher in severe compared to mild cognitive impairment. Likewise, this was 1.2h and 2.7h for functional disability and 0.3h and 0.6h for behavioral symptoms in the same directions. DISCUSSION: Estimates can be used in both single- and multi-domain health-economic models for dementia in European settings.

INTRODUCTION: The C9orf72 mutation can manifest in diverse clinical ways, including rapid cognitive decline, parkinsonism, or late-life neuropsychiatric symptoms, sometimes mimicking autoimmune encephalitis. CASE REPORT: A 64-year-old female presented to the autoimmune neurology clinic with rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) associated with episodes of headache, confusion, auditory hallucinations, and abnormal electroencephalogram. She was treated empirically at an outside hospital for possible autoimmune encephalitis with intravenous methylprednisolone, but there was no improvement, and rapid cognitive decline continued. Family history was notable for RPD with akinetic mutism in her sister, sudden severe depression followed by parkinsonism with progressive dementia in her father in his 60s, and late-life gradually progressive dementia in her mother. Additional testing revealed a low titer positive contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the serum and elevated CSF 14-3-3 protein. CSF CASPR2 IgG and real-time quaking-induced conversion for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were negative. Brain MRI showed normal parenchymal volume. Genetic testing was conducted, which identified a heterozygous pathogenic hexanucleotide tandem repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene. CONCLUSION: This case underscores the phenotypic variability of C9orf72 mutation and the importance of a detailed family history exploring young or atypical deaths and neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes. Genetic etiologies are crucial to consider in those with a family history concerning autosomal dominant inheritance patterns of early-onset dementia, parkinsonism, or late-onset psychiatric disease. Emphasis is placed on considering alternative etiologies early, particularly when there is no response to first-line immunomodulation for suspected autoimmune dementia.

BACKGROUND: Unmet social and caregiving needs can make caregiving for a person with dementia more difficult. Although national policy encourages adoption of systematic screening for health-related social risks (HRSRs) in clinical settings, the accuracy of these risk-based screening tools for detecting unmet social needs is unknown. METHODS: We used baseline data from dementia caregivers (N = 343) enrolled in a randomized controlled trial evaluating CommunityRx-Dementia, a social care intervention conducted on Chicago's South Side. We assessed caregivers' (1) unmet social and caregiving needs by querying need for 14 resource types and (2) HRSRs using the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Accountable Health Communities (AHC) screening tool. Using unmet social needs as the reference, we examined the sensitivity of the AHC tool to detect food, housing, and transportation needs. Analyses were stratified by gender. RESULTS: Most caregivers were women (78%), non-Hispanic (96%), Black (81%), partnered (58%) and had an annual household income ≥$50K (64%). Unmet social and caregiving needs were similarly prevalent among women and men caregivers (87% had ≥1 need, 43% had ≥5 needs). HRSRs were also prevalent. The most common HRSR was lack of social support (45%). Housing instability, difficulty with utilities and having any HRSRs were significantly more prevalent among women (all p < 0.05). The AHC screener had low sensitivity for detecting unmet food (39%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 27%-53%), housing (42%, 95% CI: 31%-53%), and transportation (22%, 95% CI: 14%-31%) needs. Sensitivity did not differ by gender for food (41% for women and 30% for men, p = 0.72) or housing (44% for women and 29% for men, p = 0.37) needs. For transportation needs, sensitivity was 27% for women versus 0% for men (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Men and women caregivers have high rates of unmet social needs that are often missed by the CMS-recommended risk-based screening method. Findings indicate a role for need-based screening in implementing social care.

Immune mechanisms play a fundamental role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, suggesting that approaches which target immune cells and immunologically relevant molecules can offer therapeutic opportunities beyond the recently approved amyloid beta monoclonal therapies. In this review, we provide an overview of immunomodulatory therapeutics in development, including their preclinical evidence and clinical trial results. Along with detailing immune processes involved in AD pathogenesis and highlighting how these mechanisms can be therapeutically targeted to modify disease progression, we summarize knowledge gained from previous trials of immune-based interventions, and provide a series of recommendations for the development of future immunomodulatory therapeutics to treat AD.

OBJECTIVES: Euthanasia for people with dementia is controversial and clinicians should decide how to respond to euthanasia requests. The authors aimed to investigate clinicians' perspectives on the acceptability of euthanasia for people with dementia, and differences between countries and personal characteristics potentially associated with acceptability. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, MEASUREMENTS: Cross-sectional vignette study as part of the CONT-END studies, in which the authors conducted interviews with clinicians from the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, USA, Japan, and Israel online or in-person, and logistic regression analyses to assess associations with acceptability. RESULTS: Participants included 202 physicians and three nurse specialists who assumed similar medical responsibilities. Acceptability was higher in the Netherlands (66%) than in other countries (23%-44%, OR 0.16-0.41, p = 0.003-0.03). Dutch clinicians were more often willing to perform euthanasia upon request of a person with dementia (58%) than clinicians in other countries (18%-34%, OR 0.16-0.17, p = 0.007-0.03), except for Israel (40%, OR 0.48, p = 0.07). Two coping styles, planning (OR 0.77, 95% CI [0.59, 1.00]) and religious coping (OR 0.71, 95% CI [0.60, 0.84]), were associated with lower acceptability of euthanasia. Being religious (OR 0.47, 95% CI [0.24, 0.93]), training in palliative care (OR 0.48, 95% CI [0.26, 0.91]), and using emotional social support as coping style (OR 0.77, 95% CI [0.62, 0.95]) were associated with lower willingness to perform euthanasia upon request of a person with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians' perspectives on the acceptability of euthanasia for people with dementia varied across countries and individuals, with diversity related to coping styles, training in palliative care, and religion.

Background and Objective: People living with dementia typically have poor oral health. However, studies of caries status in this population have revealed different results. This systematic review aimed to assess caries status in old adults with dementia. Method: The PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched from inception to 13 February 2025. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the risk of bias in case-control studies, and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist was used to assess the risk of bias in cross-sectional studies. Caries status was measured by the decayed, missing, filled teeth (DMFT) index, decayed, missing, filled surfaces (DMFS) index, or the component of DMFT/S. A random effects model was used to pool the included data. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to analyze the effect of dementia on caries. Results: A total of 5363 studies were retrieved, and 20 studies were included in this study. Meta-analysis showed the DMFT index (WMD: 3.76, p < 0.0001; 13 studies), decayed teeth (DT) index (WMD: 0.40, p < 0.0001; 10 studies), and missing teeth (MT) index (WMD: 3.67, p = 0.04; 7 studies) values were higher in the dementia group than the control group. There were no differences in the filled teeth (FT) index (WMD: -0.66, p = 0.09; 9 studies) between the dementia group and the control group. Conclusions: Caries status was poorer in people with dementia than the controls. These findings suggest that medical staff and caregivers need to pay more attention to the oral health of dementia patients.

Background/Objectives: Dementia leads to cognitive decline, affecting memory, reasoning, and daily activities, often requiring full-time care. Multisensory stimulation (MSS), combined with cognitive tasks, can slow this decline, improving mood, communication, and overall quality of life. This systematic review aims to explore methods that utilize MSS in the rehabilitation of patients with dementia. Its clinical value is rooted in its ability to offer a deep comprehension of how MSS can be successfully incorporated into rehabilitation treatments. Methods: Studies were identified from an online search of PubMed, EBSCOhost, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus databases with a search time frame from 2014 to 2024. This review has been registered on Open OSF (n) 3KUQX. Results: Pilot studies investigating MSS interventions, encompassing Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST), Sonas therapy, and combined physical-cognitive exercise programs, have yielded mixed findings in individuals with dementia. CST has demonstrated significant improvements in general cognitive function, particularly in language skills, offering a promising approach for cognitive enhancement. Sonas therapy, while showing positive trends in some studies, does not consistently achieve statistically significant outcomes across all cognitive domains. Conversely, combined exercise programs have shown efficacy in improving dual-task performance, suggesting benefits for motor-cognitive integration. MSS delivered within specialized environments like Snoezelen rooms consistently produces positive effects on mood, reducing agitation and promoting relaxation. Conclusions: This review emphasizes how MSS can enhance cognitive, emotional, and behavioral results for individuals with dementia. It is essential for future research to standardize protocols, incorporate advanced technologies such as virtual reality, and rectify diversity gaps. Collaboration between different fields will improve the effectiveness and usefulness of MSS in caring for individuals with dementia.

INTRODUCTION: We evaluated whether higher Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) scores were associated with increased incidence of all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia over 22.3 years of follow-up in the community-based Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort. METHODS: One thousand four hundred eighty-seven participants (mean ± standard deviation, age in years 69 ± 6) completed food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) and had incident all-cause dementia and AD surveillance data available. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-six participants developed all-cause dementia (including AD, n = 187) over a median follow-up time of 13.1 years. Higher DII scores, averaged across a maximum of three timepoints, were associated with an increased incidence of all-cause dementia and AD after adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical covariates (hazard ratio [HR] 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.33, P < 0.001; HR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.07-1.34d, P = 0.001, respectively). DISCUSSION: Higher DII scores were associated with a higher risk of incident all-cause dementia and AD. Although these promising findings need to be replicated and further validated, our results suggest that diets that correlate with low DII scores may prevent late-life dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: Higher Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) scores were associated with an increased incidence of all-cause dementia. Higher DII scores were associated with an increased incidence of Alzheimer's disease dementia. Diets that correlate with low DII scores may prevent late-life dementia.

This essay seeks to foster a dialogue between dementia care and supportive housing by examining how the core values, guiding principles, and practices in supportive housing could respond to unaddressed housing needs of people with dementia. This analysis draws upon documented and anecdotal strategies from supportive housing to move beyond the traditional dichotomy of successful aging in place versus institutionalization in skilled-nursing or memory-care settings. By considering interdisciplinary insights and interventions from mental and behavioral health alongside dementia care, we can identify novel housing options that have the potential to enhance agency, promote autonomy, and facilitate sustained social engagement for people with dementia.

BACKGROUND: Previous meta-analyses have found that systemic medications may modulate dementia risk. We aimed to provide an overview of this evidence to guide clinical practice and future research. METHODS: We conducted an umbrella review of meta-analyses (PROSPERO CRD42021226307), searching databases from inception to 15th April 2024. Only peer-reviewed meta-analyses examining dementia risk and systemic medications in humans were included. Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion, extracted study data and assessed quality of meta-analyses using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Three authors independently rated the certainty of evidence for each drug using the GRADE framework. RESULTS: 68 meta-analyses were included, across 11 drug categories. Across meta-analyses, available data were primarily observational. Confounding by indication and potential reverse causality were important limitations. Randomised-controlled data were rare but supported an association between treatment of hypertension and reduced dementia incidence. Overall, we found moderate certainty evidence of reduced risk of dementia associated with anti-hypertensives, statins, sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), and moderate certainty of increased risk with anticholinergics. DISCUSSION: Currently, there is insufficient evidence to advise repurposing any systemic drugs with the primary aim of reducing dementia risk. On the basis of our findings, we recommend proactive treatment of hypertension to reduce risk of all-cause dementia. Our findings did not find a difference between antihypertensive drug classes, but dementia risk was associated with blood pressure reading. In addition, we advise avoidance of anticholinergic drugs in cognitive impairment, with assessment of anticholinergic burden and consideration of alternatives during routine clinical contacts.

INTRODUCTION: ARTS, an in vivo marker of cerebral arteriolosclerosis, may identify older individuals at risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, and stroke due to cerebral small vessel disease, but deeper characterization in a large, diverse sample is needed. METHODS: Associations between ARTS and incident MCI, dementia, and stroke, and with several common vascular risk factors, were examined in 1226 older adults without dementia and within White (n = 707), Black (n = 400), and Latino (n = 110) subgroups. RESULTS: Higher ARTS score was associated (all ps < 0.01) with incident MCI (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.29), dementia (HR = 1.33), and stroke (HR = 1.52) and with diastolic/systolic blood pressure, self-reported hypertension, claudication, congestive heart failure, smoking, and glomerular filtration rate in the combined sample. Results varied across racial and ethnic groups. DISCUSSION: ARTS has utility as an in vivo marker of cerebral arteriolosclerosis and risk of MCI, dementia, and stroke. HIGHLIGHTS: ARTS score, an in vivo marker of cerebral arteriolosclerosis, was associated with incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, and stroke in a diverse sample. ARTS score was associated with incident dementia in the non-Latino (NL) White and NL Black subgroups separately. ARTS score was associated with incident MCI in the NL Black subgroup. Common vascular risk factors were associated with ARTS score, consistent with ex vivo studies. ARTS has utility as a marker for the risk of MCI, dementia, and stroke.

BACKGROUND: As dementia advances, symptoms and associated concerns lead to significant distress for both the patients and their caregivers. Telemedicine has the capacity to alleviate care-related issues for patients with dementia and their family caregivers. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to synthesize the implementation strategies for providing telemedicine to assist patients with dementia and their caregivers in home and community settings and to examine its effectiveness and implementation barriers. METHODS: In accordance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, a systematic search was conducted across 6 databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and ProQuest. The eligibility criteria for peer-reviewed English publications from January 2000 up to January 2025 encompassed research studies related to telemedicine services for individuals diagnosed with dementia and caregivers. RESULTS: This study included 54 articles, comprising 14,446 participants from 10 countries. In total, 4 major themes emerged from the articles: the design of telemedicine services, effectiveness of telemedicine, external environmental factors, and barriers in telemedicine implementation. Cognitive training was addressed in 28 studies. Within the domain of work and leisure, 24 solutions were identified. Most reviewed studies indicated favorable experiences with telemedicine services and highlighted perceived personal and social benefits among patients with dementia, as well as identified barriers to accessing and using such services. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should encompass the enhancement of digital accessibility for individuals with restricted resources and limited technological proficiency, the use of randomized controlled trial methodologies to ascertain the comparative efficacy of various service delivery modes, and the augmentation of sample diversity.

BackgroundImpaired daily functioning can change day-to-day activities at the early stage of dementia, in varied association with cognitive decline and/or affective symptoms. Current clinical practice uses scales to assess daily functioning and can be prone to subject/proxy-related bias.ObjectiveTo investigate the yet unclear cerebrovascular correlate of daily activities and the usefulness of cerebral blood flow (CBF) as a quantitative marker of functional impairment.MethodsNinety patients with clinically diagnosed dementia and 30 healthy controls were prospectively recruited. Regional CBF within the frontotemporal-subcortical circuits was quantified by magnetic resonance imaging, compared between control and CBF-stratified patient groups, and then correlated with basic and instrumental activities of daily living.ResultsLower CBF was found to associate with impaired daily activities in most of the regions investigated after adjusted for the effect of age and Mini-Mental State Examination score. Analyses of partial correlation and receiver operating characteristic further revealed that impaired basic activities of daily living was best detected by the baseline CBF in the right middle temporal gyrus, with the area under the curve (AUC) = 0.860 (p < 0.001). Impaired instrumental activities of daily living was best detected by the CBF in the right superior temporal gyrus (AUC = 0.695, p < 0.001). The CBF in the two regions showed no significant detecting ability for anxiety and depression.ConclusionsWe identified the cerebrovascular correlates of daily functioning in line with the previously conceptualized role of frontotemporal-subcortical circuits, allowing quantitative assessment of daily activities with minimal confounding from affective symptoms.

As the number of people with dementia increase, an additional 1.2 million direct care workers will be required for their care by 2030. As innovative approaches to dementia care continue to emerge, it remains essential that caregivers' thoughts and perspectives are considered. Participants in our study shared their observations of positive changes among residents living with dementia after implementation of SAIDO Learning©. This is the first study to explore staff/volunteer insight on this non-pharmacological, cognitive intervention. A qualitative, descriptive study was conducted to explore staff and volunteer thoughts, feelings, and perceptions as providers of a non-pharmacologic intervention (SAIDO Learning©) for persons living with dementia. Three themes emerged: Changes in residents, culture within the retirement community, and building relationships with residents. Globally, as the population ages, this research is critical within the field of nursing as it will expand our knowledge and delivery of nursing care for clients living with dementia.

Dementia describes when a person has cognitive limitations that impede function. Persons with kidney disease are unduly impacted by dementia: up to 87% of the dialysis population has cognitive impairment. In this review, we discuss the diagnosis and management of dementia, including the role of cerebrovascular disease and other risk factors. We review the available screening tools for the diagnosis of dementia. We discuss how the diagnosis of dementia differs from the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and also detail how delirium and depression can mimic dementia. In terms of treatments for dementia, we highlight 4 components. First, we describe pharmacologic treatments for the management of dementia, including the cholinesterase inhibitors N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonists as well as the newer antiamyloid antibody drugs for Alzheimer dementia. Second, we discuss the importance of nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of dementia, especially exercise. Third, we review approaches for the behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with dementia, including potential medication management. Fourth, we highlight the essential and valuable role of caregivers in both the diagnosis and management of dementia. We conclude with key considerations about the impact of dementia for persons receiving dialysis and the role of dementia in kidney transplant evaluation.

This chapter was written during a moment of flux in the unravelling of the plaques, tangles, and tales that characterise over thirty years of research for treatments of dementia involving humans and animals. In the autumn of 2022, there were widely circulated reports in the mainstream media of a pharmaceutical breakthrough following long periods of investment in the so-called ‘amyloid cascade hypothesis’ (ACH). This focused on the small benefits in slowing cognitive decline for some people using the drug lecanemab. While modest, the results were reported as a significant success: ending ‘decades of failure’ and promising a step towards ‘a new era of drugs to treat Alzheimer’s’ (BBC News, 2022). However, even amid celebrations there were cautions about the wider potential of this drug, which could only be given to people with early Alzheimer’s disease who had evidence of amyloid plaques from scans or spinal fluid analysis, excluding the 98% of people who were untested, many other types of dementia, and those in the later stages of disease (Walsh et al., 2022). The success of lecanemab had been constructed, or fabricated, through careful articulation of the relations between one version of dementia, the associated animal models, targeted drug pathways, and a particular patient population. Yet, this highly specific ‘scientific breakthrough’ (Brown, 2000) achieved extensive celebratory media currency after many years of unfulfilled expectations for all those hoping for a cure for dementia. We use the story of this scientific breakthrough to frame our exploration of the organisation of translational research on dementia using mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. We are interested in how the trajectories of drug development tightly knit together particular animals, humans, and drug pathways by focusing on the specific biological processes that can be modelled, evidenced, and altered in multi-species experimental systems (Davies, 2010, 2013b; Milne, 2020). We are also interested in the forms of dementia and other ways of doing research that fall outside of these biological pathways. While the therapeutic breakthroughs enabled by the ACH are to be celebrated, they raise a challenging issue for constructing multispecies dementia in biomedical research. Bringing animal models in the laboratory and humans in the clinic into sufficiently close relations so that manipulations in one organism effectively model processes relevant to therapeutic outcomes in another means bracketing off alternative research options and the multiplicity of human experiences of dementia. Making decisions about which animal model to progress has implications for both the animals used in research and the humans affected by this health condition. We are interested in how we might tell stories about research and drug development that are more accountable to the multiplicity of people and animals’ lives they touch. We use the concept of how mouse models are ‘fabricated’ in dementia research to focus attention on these processes of decision-making in science. We use this concept to unpack how disease models are fabricated as a way of bringing the decisions made by researchers in specific research trajectories into conversation with the decisions made by people affected by dementia who are reviewing new research proposals for medical charities. We explain our use of the concept of fabrication more fully below but note here that we consider fabrication an important process in all scientific research in which decisions to focus on certain things give shape to the tools, techniques, animals, and evidence that are built into research pathways. Yet we use the term acknowledging it can have a pejorative meaning too. These processes are fallible and open to other kinds of fabrication and forgery that reflect motivations and methods in science; though malfeasance is only a small part of the uncertainties around reproducible and responsible science (Macleod and the University of Edinburgh Research Strategy Group, 2022). The stories of dementia research contain irresponsible behaviour as well as successful breakthroughs for science; repeatedly deferred hope as well as expectations realised for people affected by dementia. We start by discussing our use of the concept of fabrication and introduce the research we draw on in this chapter. We then present two different ways of telling stories about the organisation of multispecies biomedical research on dementia. First, we trace the experimental practices used to construct mouse models within the ACH. This focuses on how researchers fabricate the animals and patient populations that link and make visible the specific biological pathways they hope will make a difference to disease trajectories. Second, we explore how people affected by dementia, acting as patient representatives in reviewing proposals for new biomedical research, locate themselves and their families within these stories of recurrent hope and delayed promise. We explore how they relate to the animals they encounter in research proposals and their responsibilities to others affected by dementia. While the future biomedical research trajectories of the ACH are underpinned by the translations made possible by transgenic animals based on specific family genomes, the patient representatives we spoke to wanted to acknowledge a wider set of relations, drawing attention to the importance of equity and balance to benefit those affected by Alzheimer’s disease now. We conclude by reflecting on the different dimensions of accountability in dementia research and the challenge of working between multispecies relations and the multiple versions of dementia.

Alzheimer's disease is regarded as a type of dementia that has significantly affected a large population, thus posing a global health concern. The amyloid beta hypothesis and tau pathology define the disease pathology. The hallmarks of this disease are defined by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, thus supporting the theories presented above. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation can also serve as therapeutic targets for treatment. Current conventional treatments have focused on managing the symptoms rather than modifying the disease. One of the major challenges this delivery systems face is their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier; hence, the development of nanoparticle delivery systems incorporates the required active component and utilizes different mechanisms such as transcytosis, cell-mediated transport, or advanced techniques to surpass the blood-brain barrier. Bioactive components possess multiple advantages such as being anti-inflammatory and antioxidant in nature. They also target the main pathology involved in the aggregation of amyloid fibres and hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Various bioactive nanoparticles have been demonstrated in disease models to operate on certain targets and facilitate blood-brain barrier crossing. The article also covers the salient features of some of the nanoparticle systems under investigation separating them based on the norms of those aimed at addressing various disease pathologies. Despite being able to address the main issues with traditional drug delivery, they nevertheless have some disadvantages, such as toxicity, bioavailability, and regulatory barriers. However, the prospects for bioactive nanoparticles appear bright.

The use of neurostimulation devices for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing field. In this review, we examine the mechanism of action and therapeutic indications of these neurostimulation devices in the AD process. Rapid advancements in neurostimulation technologies are providing non-pharmacological relief to patients affected by AD pathology. Neurostimulation therapies include electrical stimulation that targets the circuitry-level connection in important brain areas such as the hippocampus to induce therapeutic neuromodulation of dysfunctional neural circuitry and electromagnetic field (EMF) stimulation that targets anti-amyloid molecular pathways to promote the degradation of beta-amyloid (Aβ). These devices target specific or diffuse cortical and subcortical brain areas to modulate neuronal activity at the electrophysiological or molecular pathway level, providing therapeutic effects for AD. This review attempts to determine the most effective and safe neurostimulation device for AD and provides an overview of potential and current clinical indications. Several EMF devices have shown a beneficial or harmful effect in cell cultures and animal models but not in AD human studies. These contradictory results may be related to the stimulation parameters of these devices, such as frequency, penetration depth, power deposition measured by specific absorption rate, time of exposure, type of cell, and tissue dielectric properties. Based on this, determining the optimal stimulation parameters for EMF devices in AD and understanding their mechanism of action is essential to promote their clinical application, our review suggests that repeated EMF stimulation (REMFS) is the most appropriate device for human AD treatments. Before its clinical application, it is necessary to consider the complicated and interconnected genetic and epigenetic effects of REMFS-biological system interaction. This will move forward the urgently needed therapy of EMF in human AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is one common type of dementia. Numerous studies have suggested a correlation between Alzheimer's disease and inflammation. The inflammasome is the core of the inflammatory response and plays an important role in the inflammatory response. Currently, ample evidence has shown that inflammasomes are closely related to the occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: To explore the evolution and development trends of inflammasomes in Alzheimer's disease using bibliometric and knowledge mapping analysis. By identifying research hotspots and emerging topics, we aim to provide new insights and directions for researchers in this field. METHODS: All data related to inflammasomes in Alzheimer's disease from 2000 to 2024 were collected from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), and annual publications, national publication trends, and proportion charts were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad price v8.0.2. Additionally, CiteSpace (6.2.4R (64-bit) Advanced Edition), and VOSviewer (version 1.6.18) were used to analyze and visualize these data. RESULTS: A total of 1,128 publications related to the inflammasome in Alzheimer's disease were recorded in the WoSCC, comprising 738 articles and 390 reviews. The literature was mainly from 68 countries/regions and 1,545 institutions, particularly China (n = 464) and the USA (n = 266). Despite China's leading in publication quantity, the United States holds a prominent position in the field due to the higher quality of its scholarly articles. The institution that contributes the most publications is the Helmholtz Association. JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES was a prolific contributor, and Nature was the most frequently cited journal. Keyword analysis showed that nlrp3 inflammasome, neuroinflammation, microglia activation, and amyloid-beta were the most common terms, reflecting the main research interests in currently published papers in this field. Research in this field primarily focuses on the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is closely associated with pathological products like Aβ and tau proteins. It can induce pyroptosis and accelerate the progression of Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: The NLRP3 inflammasome is critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, the peak of related literature was in 2023, suggesting a potential decline in this research hotspot. There is an urgent need to explore new pathogenic mechanisms for AD. Clearly, this is an important direction that requires deep thinking and breakthroughs.

The identification of active interventions in neurodegenerative disorders is a major challenge in neurology; the use of repurposed drugs may represent a valuable strategy. Tetracyclines, a second generation of antibiotic molecules, offer various potential applications. Following an anecdotal observation of the potential anti-amyloidogenic activity of iododoxorubicin, the search for chemical analogs with a better safety profile led to tetracyclines. Their heterocyclic structures with a planar conformation interfere with b-sheet amyloid formation. Thus, doxycycline, a derivative with favorable blood-brain barrier penetration, emerged as a strong candidate to combat peripheral and central amyloidosis. In particular, we tested the anti-prion activity of doxycycline in vitro and in vivo experiments, confirming its capacity to disrupt or inhibit the formation of prion protein aggregates associated with pathological events. Treatment with doxycycline in human subjects with prion - related encephalopathies yielded contradictory results, suggesting that a preventive approach is a more favorable condition to verify efficacy; a clinical trial involving subjects at genetic risk of developing fatal familial insomnia, exposed to doxycycline for ten years, is currently ongoing. The anti-amyloidogenic capacity of doxycycline, combined with its safety profile in long-term treatment, has suggested its use in peripheral amyloidosis, which was tested with positive results. A specific interaction with β-amyloid or α-synuclein oligomers, as well as tau aggregation has also been demonstrated. More recently, the action of doxycycline has been extended to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacities. In particular, the anti-inflammatory activity of doxycycline may explain the drug 's efficacy in numerous experimental models where protein misfolding has been associated with neuroinflammation, including Huntington's and Parkinson' s diseases. Thus, the pleiotropic action of doxycycline appears to be an interesting tool for addressing progressive neuronal dysfunction in multifactorial neurodegenerative diseases. The application of precision medicine principles to doxycycline treatment represents the best strategy to determine its efficacy. These aspects are illustrated here concerning another pleiotropic tetracycline, minocycline.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading neurodegenerative disorder recognized by progressive cognitive decline and behavioral changes. The pathology of AD is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, which leads to synaptic loss and subsequent neurodegeneration. Additional contributors to disease progression include metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory factors. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is also implicated, as it plays a crucial role in tau phosphorylation and the progression of neurodegeneration. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of various phytomolecules and their potential to target multiple aspects of AD pathology. We examined natural products from diverse classes, including stilbenes, flavonoids, phenolic acids, alkaloids, coumarins, terpenoids, chromenes, cannabinoids, chalcones, phloroglucinols, and polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAPs). The key mechanisms of action of these phytomolecules include modulating tau protein dynamics to reduce aggregation, inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to maintain neurotransmitter levels and enhance cognitive function, and inhibiting β-secretase (BACE1) to decrease Aβ production. Additionally, some phytomolecules were found to influence GSK-3β activity, thereby impacting tau phosphorylation and neurodegeneration. By addressing multiple targets, Aβ production, tau hyperphosphorylation, AChE activity, and GSK-3β, these natural products offer a promising multi-targeted approach to AD therapy. This review highlights their potential to develop effective treatments that not only mitigate core pathological features but also manage the complex, multifactorial aspects of AD progression.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia is a rising global health challenge. Advances in large-scale proteomics and genetic databases have enabled high-throughput screening approaches to uncover novel mechanistic pathways and therapeutic targets. METHODS: This study used a Mendelian randomization framework to examine genetic associations of 2172 plasma proteins (UK Biobank, n = 54,219) with: (1) dementia subtypes (FinnGen, n = 429,209), including Alzheimer's disease (n = 12,348), vascular dementia (n = 2667), and Parkinson's disease dementia (n = 589); and (2) global neuroimaging markers (UK Biobank), including white matter hyperintensities (n = 42,310), fractional anisotropy (n = 17,663), and mean diffusivity (n = 17,467). RESULT: Multiple potential causal protein-outcome relationships were identified, corroborating known associations (e.g., apolipoprotein E, synaptosomal-associated protein 25) and uncovering more novel proteins (e.g., butyrophilin subfamily 3 member A2, granzyme A, contactin-2, and trefoil factor 3) potentially involved in dementia disease processes. DISCUSSION: The identified proteins have diverse functions spanning immune regulation, cellular proliferation, neuronal stability, and neuroinflammation. The findings increase our understanding of disease processes governing cognitive health and highlight candidate proteins with potential as new disease biomarkers or therapeutic targets. HIGHLIGHTS: We used Mendelian randomization to link 2172 plasma proteins to dementia and brain imaging traits.Apolipoprotein E, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, and Fc receptor-like 3 showed protective associations across dementia subtypes.Butyrophilin subfamily 3 member A2, granzyme A, contactin-2, and trefoil factor 3 were uncovered as novel dementia-associated proteins.Immune, metabolic, and vascular pathways were implicated in the etiology of dementia.

Shared remembering is one of the most common ways we experience memory, and its role may become especially salient in aging and dementia. While laboratory studies of collaborative recall often show costs such as collaborative inhibition, research with older couples and families, and in care contexts highlights how joint remembering can provide essential memory support. In aging, collaboration with close others can facilitate memory, and in aged care, structured reminiscence interventions boost recall. In dementia, vicarious remembering by care partners can sustain identity and social connection, even when an individual's ability to recall and narrate past events is impaired. We highlight the mechanisms by which shared remembering can benefit older people, the conditions under which collaboration helps rather than hinders, and the practical value of translating this knowledge into care practices.

This study aims to explore the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in classifying dementia severity based on gait analysis data and to examine how machine learning (ML) can address the limitations of conventional statistical approaches. The study included 34 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 25 with mild dementia, 26 with moderate dementia, and 54 healthy controls. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was employed to categorize dementia severity using gait parameters. As complexity and high dimensionality of gait data increase, traditional statistical methods may struggle to capture subtle patterns and interactions among variables. In contrast, ML techniques, including dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and gradient-based feature selection, can effectively identify key gait features relevant to dementia severity classification. This study shows that ML can complement traditional statistical analyses by efficiently handling high-dimensional data and uncovering meaningful patterns that may be overlooked by conventional methods. Our findings highlight the promise of AI-based tools in advancing our understanding of gait characteristics in dementia and supporting the development of more accurate diagnostic models for complex or large datasets.

Background Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are growing public health concerns. Early and accurate differentiation between cognitively normal (NL), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia is essential for timely intervention. Structural MRI biomarkers-such as grey matter volume (GMV), white matter volume (WMV), white matter hyperintensity volume (WMH), AD signature (a meta-region of interest), and hippocampal occupancy score (HOC)-offer promise for objectively staging cognitive decline. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of MRI-derived neuroimaging measures using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to identify optimal thresholds for distinguishing between NL, MCI, and dementia. Methods Data were collected from 466 participants at the KU Alzheimer's Disease Research Center between 2010 and 2025. T1-weighted MRI scans were preprocessed using SPM12 and VBM12. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, Tukey's HSD, Welch's t-tests, and ROC analyses. Youden's J statistic was used to determine optimal cut-points, and multivariate models assessed combined biomarker performance. Results Significant differences were found across diagnostic groups for GMV, WMH, AD signature, and HOC. ROC analysis for Demented vs the control group (NL) showed GMV had an AUC of 0.674 [0.6164, 0.7325], WMH an AUC of 0.700 [0.6454, 0.7539], AD signature an AUC of 0.829 [0.780, 0.8761], and HOC the highest individual performance with an AUC of 0.878 [0.8426, 0.9144]. Further ROC analysis confirmed AD signature and HOC as the most effective biomarkers (AUCs = 0.78 and 0.81) for distinguishing MCI/demented from NL. In MCI vs. demented comparisons, AD signature and HOC biomarkers had AUCs of 0.70 and 0.73, respectively. Conclusions MRI-derived biomarkers, particularly AD signature and HOC, show strong potential for differentiating cognitive impairment stages. ROC-based thresholds offer clinically actionable metrics that can improve diagnostic precision.

BACKGROUND: While nearly half of all dementia cases are potentially preventable, early detection and targeted interventions are critical. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced clinical prediction models offer promising tools to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy by leveraging machine learning (ML) to integrate diverse data sources. This systematic review evaluates the development, performance, and clinical applicability of AI-based prediction models in dementia. METHODS: Searches of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science identified peer-reviewed studies up to October 2024, focusing on AI-based models predicting dementia onset. Included studies were assessed for model accuracy, bias, and generalizability using the PROBAST tool. Data extraction adhered to the TRIPOD and CHARMS frameworks, capturing study design, participant demographics, predictor variables, and performance metrics. RESULTS: Among 2699 articles initially screened, 21 studies were included, encompassing over 1 million participants. AI models, extremely heterogenous for their nature, demonstrated good predictive accuracy, with a mean area under the curve of 0.845. While internal validation was conducted in all studies, external validation was limited. Models incorporating ML methods like random forests and support vector machines outperformed traditional approaches. The most used parameters were clinical and cognitive data, whilst data about biomarkers were the less used. Risk of bias was generally low, though calibration and generalizability remained challenges. CONCLUSIONS: AI-based prediction models show strong potential for early dementia detection and personalized care. However, their integration into clinical practice requires addressing issues of external validation, data representativeness, and model interpretability. Further research should focus on robust validation and ethical implementation to optimize their utility in dementia care.

The World Health Organization has set a target for 75% of member states to have national dementia plans by 2025. These plans should align with human rights standards, such as the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The aim of this study was to complete a review of global national dementia plans and their human rights content according to the convention's principles. A categorization matrix of preidentified human rights themes was produced prior to data collection and extensive inclusion criteria were adopted to ensure thorough assessment using deductive content analysis. Each dementia plan was reviewed by at least two independent assessors. Forty plans were included in the final analysis. We found that basic human rights were covered by the plans, with community inclusion acknowledged in 39 plans (97.5%). However, there was less coverage of non-coercive practices and the participation of people with dementia in the design and delivery of services or policies, with only 24 plans (60%) mentioning these aspects. This is the first global review of human rights content within national dementia plans. More must be done to ensure that all such plans align with human rights standards so that the human rights of persons with dementia are respected, protected, and promoted.

BackgroundAntipsychotic medications are frequently prescribed in people with dementia (PwD), despite concern regarding risk-benefit balance.ObjectiveTo describe the evolution of antipsychotic prescribing for PwD in Spain, with special interest in the effect of administration regulatory warnings (2004 and 2008).MethodsLongitudinal retrospective study using the national Spanish Database for Pharmacoepidemiological Research in Primary Care (BIFAP). We included patients with incident dementia during the study period (January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2018) and excluded those with major psychiatric conditions, mental retardation, or previous use of antipsychotics. Paper-based and electronic prescriptions of antipsychotics were collected. Annual prevalence of prescribing was obtained for single medications and antipsychotic group. All calculations were conducted for the total sample and stratified by sex. The results were compared with those of other countries.ResultsAntipsychotic prescribing doubled during the study period, raising from 12.6% (2002) to 23.8% (2018). A mild decrease of prescribing was observed from 2004 to 2007, followed by steady increase from 2007 on. This increase was due to atypical antipsychotic use, specifically quetiapine, which grew from 0.2% (2002) to 16.4% (2018) and was more frequently utilized in men. Spain prevalence of antipsychotics doubled the UK's.ConclusionsBetter designed warnings appear as a key means to rationalize use of antipsychotics in Spain and other countries, ideally as part of national dementia strategies. Dearly needed non-pharmacological approaches for comprehensive treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms could be generalized as a first step through nursing home and day care networks. Quetiapine requires the agencies' urgent attention.

IMPORTANCE: The association between grandchild care and dementia remains unclear, with previous studies yielding mixed results and unclear mechanisms. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between grandchild care and dementia odds and to explore the mediating roles of mobile telephone ownership, broadband internet access, and reduced loneliness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study from 2013 to 2018. Data analysis was conducted from March 10, 2024, to April 20, 2025. Multistage, stratified, cluster sampling was used to recruit participants from 28 provinces across China. Data were collected through biennial, computer-assisted personal interviews. The analytic sample comprised Chinese adults aged 50 to 79 years who were dementia free at baseline. EXPOSURE: Grandchild caregiving was classified into 4 groups: noncaregivers (0 hours per week), nonintensive caregivers (1-39 hours per week), intensive caregivers (≥40 hours per week), and those without grandchildren. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Dementia was assessed using both self-reports and proxy measures, with dementia defined by scores of 0 to 6 on the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status or a score of 4 or higher on the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly. RESULTS: From an initial cohort of 18 605 participants, 10 058 were included (5062 men [50.3%]; 4996 women [49.7%]; mean [SD] age, 60.9 [7.2] years). Nonintensive grandchild caregiving was associated with lower odds of dementia (odds ratio [OR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60-0.97) than no grandchild care. The mediation analysis revealed that the association of nonintensive grandchild care with dementia odds was partially mediated by mobile telephone ownership (17.68%; 95% CI, 2.05%-37.23%), broadband internet access (17.36%; 95% CI, 5.37%-30.05%), and reduced loneliness (16.83%; 95% CI, 4.52%-30.24%), with a combined mediating proportion of 36.99% (95% CI, 25.01%-51.41%). Neither intensive grandchild caregiving nor having no grandchildren was associated with dementia odds, and no significant indirect effects were observed through the mediators examined. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of older Chinese adults, nonintensive grandchild caregiving was associated with lower odds of dementia, partly owing to increased digital technology access and reduced loneliness. Promoting digital inclusion and social engagement could be beneficial for cognitive health, particularly among older adults providing moderate levels of grandchild care.

This paper draws attention to the significant public health challenge that dementia represents in Australia as one of the leading causes of death and disease burden. In Australia alone, the number of people living with dementia is expected to double within 30 years. Evidence suggests that almost half of all dementia cases worldwide could be prevented by addressing modifiable risk factors across the life course. With no effective medical treatment or cure for dementia, it stands to reason that economic investment should be directed towards preventing dementia and reducing risk by addressing modifiable risk factors at both individual and population levels. Attention must be afforded to the health inequities that exist, and consideration given to appropriate messaging and approaches to target the various cultural, commercial and social determinants of health associated with increased dementia risk across different population groups. Furthermore, critical messaging about dementia risk is largely absent from health campaigns, contributing to the low levels of understanding and awareness of dementia in the Australian public. Therefore, there is a need for urgent investment in a co-designed large-scale public health campaign targeting key modifiable risk factors for dementia to improve population brain health and reduce the societal impact of this condition.

Ageing populations worldwide face increasing challenges of multimorbidity (that is, the co-occurrence of two or more chronic conditions). The combination of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia occurs more frequently than it would by simple coincidence, owing to several underlying biological and clinical mechanisms. Population-based cohort studies are an important epidemiological tool and have contributed to improved understanding of these mechanisms. These mechanisms include uniquely shared haemodynamic features of vasculature, overlapping risk factor profiles, and direct neurotoxic effects of accumulating waste products due to poor kidney function. The effect of these pathways is suggested to differ across gender, relevant demographic subgroups, and populations from low- to middle-income countries. Yet, given their study design, population-based cohort studies also inherently face several methodological challenges. These challenges pertain to the use of biomarkers that do not always fully capture the structure and function of the kidney or the brain; bidirectionality across the pathways under study; and practical issues of proper causal inference in light of incomplete distinction between confounders, mediators and effect modifiers. This Review describes our current understanding of the link between CKD and dementia, with a focus on knowledge synthesized from population-based cohort studies. Methodological challenges and possible solutions will be described and directions for future research areas will be outlined.

UNC13A (rs12608932-CC) is associated with both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and shortens survival in ALS. We aim to describe the association for UNC13A and survival in FTD. We included 626 patients with FTD from Dutch memory clinics, including a subcohort of 150 patients with TDP-43 pathology. Survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models in a recessive manner. Homozygosity for rs12608932-C in UNC13A was associated with a shorter survival compared with other genotypes (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-1.60, p = 0.033), which has implications for patient counselling and trial design.

INTRODUCTION: A better understanding of who will develop dementia can inform patient care. Although MRI offers prognostic insights, access is limited globally, whereas CT-imaging is readily available in acute stroke. We explored the prognostic utility of acute CT-imaging for predicting dementia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) survivors from participating stroke centres in Scotland. Acute CT-scans were rated using ordinal scales for neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular changes (old infarcts, white matter lesions (WMLs), medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), and global atrophy (GA)) and combined together to a 'brain-frailty' score. Dementia status was established at 18-months following stroke or TIA. RESULTS: Among 195 participants, 33% had dementia after 3 years of follow-up. High brain-frailty score (⩾2/4) correlated with higher risk of dementia (HR (95% CI) 6.02 (1.89-19.21)). As individual predictor, severe MTA was most strongly associated with dementia (adjusted HR (95% CI) 2.09 (1.07-4.08)). Other predictors associated with dementia included older age, higher prestroke morbidity (mRS), WMLs, and GA. Integrated in a prediction model with clinical parameters, prestroke mRS, cardiovascular disease, GA, MTA and Abbreviated-Mental-Test were the strongest predictors of dementia (c-statistic: 0.77). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Increased brain-frailty, and its individual components (WMLs, MTA, and GA) are associated with a higher risk of dementia in participants with stroke. Combining clinical and brain-frailty parameters created a moderate dementia prediction model but added little value over clinical parameters in combination with cognitive testing. CT-based brain-frailty may provide better prognostic insights when cognitive testing isn't feasible and for identifying highest-risk individuals for dementia prevention trials to increase trial efficiency.

BACKGROUND: Lewy body diseases, including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), are characterized by α-synuclein accumulation, leading to dementia. Previous studies suggest distinct epigenetic and metabolomic profiles in DLB. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify diagnostic biomarkers by analyzing the methylome and metabolome in the Brodmann area 7 of postmortem brain tissues from DLB patients and control subjects using multiomics approaches. METHODS: Methylation analysis was performed using the Illumina EPIC array, and metabolomics profiling was conducted via (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and direct injection/liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Differential methylation and metabolite analysis were conducted, followed by pathway enrichment to explore biological relevance. RESULTS: We identified 3478 significantly differentially methylated cytosines, mostly hypermethylated, enriched in CpG islands near transcription start sites. Pathway enrichment analysis showed significant pathways, primarily linked to olfactory and synaptic functions. Metabolomics profiling identified 15 significantly altered metabolites, with Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) Biosynthesis being the most affected pathway. Key correlations between differentially methylated cytosines and metabolites, particularly in the PE Biosynthesis pathway involving PTDSS1 and PCYT2 genes, were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Notably, sex-specific differences were found, with females exhibiting more epigenetic and metabolomic changes than males. Increased hypermethylation, linked to transcriptional silencing, and disruptions in PE biosynthesis suggest a role in synaptic dysfunction and olfactory deficits. In addition, α-aminoadipic acid was strongly associated with vascular functions, hinting at a possible overlap between vascular health and DLB. This study provides new insights into DLB mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. © 2024 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster is a potential risk factor for dementia. The effectiveness of the recombinant zoster vaccine for preventing dementia is uncertain. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used de-identified claims data from the Optum Labs Data Warehouse database from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2022, to determine whether the recombinant zoster vaccine is associated with a reduced risk of dementia. Immunocompetent patients with ≥365 days of continuous enrollment were included, with the risk period starting upon age-eligibility for the recombinant zoster vaccination. Cox regression adjusted for time-fixed and time-updated measures every six months was implemented to estimate hazard ratios for dementia. Herpes zoster diagnosis and antiviral therapy were also assessed. RESULTS: There were 4,502,678 individuals (median [IQR] age, 62 [54-71] years; 51 % female) included in this study: 206,297 (4.6 %) were partially vaccinated, and 460,413 (10.2 %) were fully vaccinated. The incidence rate of dementia was 99.1 cases per 10,000 person-years in the fully vaccinated group, 108.2 cases per 10,000 person-years in the partially vaccinated group, and 135.0 cases per 10,000 person-years in the unvaccinated group. After adjustment, vaccination was significantly associated with a decreased risk of dementia for two doses (hazard ratio (HR): 0.68; 95 % CI: 0.67-0.70; P < .001) and for one dose (HR 0.89; 95 % CI: 0.87-0.92; P < .001). Having a herpes zoster diagnosis before the first vaccination dose was associated with an increased hazard of dementia (HR 1.47; 95 % CI: 1.42-1.52; P < .001) compared to those with no diagnosis. Antivirals used to treat zoster infection were protective against dementia (HR 0.42; 95 % CI: 0.40-0.44; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the recombinant zoster vaccine is associated with a decreased risk of dementia and highlight an additional benefit of vaccination beyond preventing herpes zoster.

OBJECTIVE: The assessment of sexual consent capacity has been a challenge due to its dynamic nature, influenced by factors such as time, environment, individuals involved, and the nature of activities. Particularly in people living with dementia, the complexity is intensified with the interplay of the disease's impact, residential care setting, and legal constraints. This amplifies the dilemma faced by practitioners-whether to prioritize protection or encourage and support sexual expression. This article aims to provide a sensible approach to uphold the sexual autonomy of people living with dementia while mitigating the potential risks of them being involved as either perpetrators or victims. METHODS: In this narrative review, a literature search spanning from 1990 to 2023 was carried out on PubMed. Relevant articles on people living with dementia and topics related to sexuality were scrutinized. RESULTS: 41 relevant articles identified themes related to the impact of cognitive impairment on sexuality, challenges in residential care facilities, sexual consent capacity assessment models, and ethical frameworks regarding sexual rights and law. CONCLUSION: Discussions highlight the often neglected influence of prolonged suppression of sexual expression and the benefits of actualization of sexual autonomy, especially in people living with dementia, whose sense of identity is fading. It scrutinizes the limitations of existing sexual consent capacity evaluation models, emphasizing ethical concerns, practical challenges, and the need for a more balanced approach. Proposed strategies advocate for a shift from a gatekeeper to a facilitator role, offering principles for setting educational programs and policies to mitigate obstacles, supporting sexual rights, and safeguarding vulnerable groups.

Providing a dementia diagnosis is challenging, especially in primary care and considering diverse patient backgrounds. The Alzheimer Society of Canada (ASC), the College of Family Physicians of Canada, and the Canadian Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia (CCCDTD) guideline group partnered with patients, care partners, and clinicians to generate contemporaneous guidance for primary care practitioners. While relevant to all communities, Black and Chinese Canadians were formally represented in working groups. A literature review identified needs areas. Informed by Guidelines International Network (GIN) principles and through iterative group meetings with all partners, these needs were explored and incorporated into guidance. The Compassionate Language and Empathetic Approaches for Respectful Dementia Disclosure (CLEAR) offers recommendations on: holistic engagement, fostering hope, acknowledging care partners, identifying disclosing clinicians, appointment structure and environment, person-centered communication, specific discussion topics, and emotional supports, all through a cultural competence lens. These guidelines address communication challenges in disclosing a dementia diagnosis and enhancing care and support for persons living with dementia and their care partners. HIGHLIGHTS: Healthcare practitioners (HCPs) struggle with disclosing and communicating dementia diagnoses. Guidance is limited in primary care and different patient ethnocultural groups. We developed culturally sensitive guidelines with scripts and practical materials. Appropriate communication techniques and terminology are recommended in Compassionate Language and Empathetic Approaches for Respectful Dementia Disclosure (CLEAR). Patient-centered and holistic approaches for the patient and care partner are emphasized.

Sex influences cognitive aging and dementia, yet research on the impact of female-specific factors, such as parity and fetal sex, on later-life cognition remains limited and equivocal. Inconsistencies in the literature may reflect varying effects across cognitive domains and dementia status. This study reviewed data from female participants of the University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimer and Related Dementias (UBCH CARD) to examine how parity and son-to-daughter ratio affect performance on medial temporal lobe-dependent (episodic memory) and prefrontal lobe-dependent (executive function) tasks depending on dementia status. Among females with dementia, higher parity was associated with reduced episodic memory but enhanced executive function performance, whereas a greater son-to-daughter ratio was associated with reduced executive function performance. These relationships were not observed in cognitively normal females or those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. These results emphasize the importance of integrating sex-specific factors into research and the development of precision therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine differences in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) among young-onset dementia (YOD) diagnoses. METHODS: Participants were included from Amsterdam Dementia and Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LEADS) cohorts, with diagnoses of typical Alzheimer's disease (AD), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), primary progressive aphasia (PPA), posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) established in multidisciplinary meetings. We compared overall IADL scores and item level scores between groups using multiple regression analyses, adjusted for cohort, demographics, and disease severity. RESULTS: We included 582 YOD patients (58.4 ± 4.2 years; 59%F), with overall moderate IADL problems (47.5 ± 8.57). DLB patients showed the most IADL difficulties (41.8 ± 7.8) compared to PCA, typical AD, bvFTD, and PPA (adjusted β range 4.62 to 14.14, all p < 0.01), whereas PPA patients showed the least IADL difficulties (55.8 ± 9.83), with item-specific differences. CONCLUSION: We found differences in everyday functioning between YOD types. Understanding IADL in YOD types will assist in care planning. HIGHLIGHTS: Patients with DLB showed the most IADL difficulties compared to PCA, typical AD, bvFTD, and PPA Patients with PPA showed the least IADL difficulties compared to DLB, PCA, typical AD, and bvFTD We identified diagnostic group-specific activity challenges. While 'working' was among the most commonly impaired activities across al groups, distinct functional challenges emerged per diagnosis: for example, DLB had high impairment in financial tasks, PCA patients in visual-spatial tasks, and bvFTD with planning and organizational activities (e.g. making appointments).

This essay considers policy narratives of aging and dementia, what they do, and where they lead. It is argued that a renewed policy narrative of dementia is long overdue, and the authors reflect upon the value of drawing on the established age-friendly cities and communities movement to help guide the crafting of this new narrative. The essay develops three points: first, that efforts to promote an age- and latterly dementia-friendly agenda have elided a series of tensions within each program; second, that these tensions often materialize and are perhaps best understood at the point where policy is implemented and "lived out"; and third, that such points of friction provide a useful focus for future dialogue between the hitherto largely parallel and disconnected trajectories of age- and dementia-friendly agendas. Fostering such a dialogue can strengthen an evolving policy critique and ultimately help refine policy-making.

Dementia and cataracts are two leading causes of disability among the elderly population throughout the world. The relationship between both pathologies remains underrecognized. This paper explores the emerging evidence linking cataracts to cognitive decline and dementia, proposing that visual impairment may contribute to neurodegeneration. Popular hypotheses supporting these claims include circadian rhythm disruption, sensory deprivation, reduced social engagement, and increased cognitive load. Epidemiological data supports the co-prevalence of cataracts and dementia. Patients undergoing cataract removal have shown improved performance on cognitive assessments, suggesting that vision correction may enhance neural efficiency and quality of life; moreover, interventional studies demonstrate that cataract surgery not only improves visual impairment but may also slow cognitive deterioration. This paper also elucidates the clinical and public health implications of the integration of vision care into cognitive health strategies. The global dementia burden is projected to rise sharply in the coming decades; we propose that early intervention through cataract surgery may offer a cost-effective method to preserve cognitive function. Ultimately, identifying and treating visual impairment may serve as a crucial step toward delaying the progression of dementing illnesses.

Cholinotrophic basal forebrain (CTBF) neurons depend upon the complex interaction of both upstream and downstream nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling pathways for survival and function. Although dysfunction of the NGF system occurs in both Down syndrome (DS), not all individuals with DS develop dementia. Whether NGF system dysregulation differs between demented individuals with DS (DSD+) versus those without dementia (DSD-) is unknown. Here, we report a significant reduction in neurons positive for the p75(NTR) within the nucleus basalis of Meynert in DSD+, but not DSD-, compared to aged-matched controls (AMC). ChAT positive cells were significantly lower in DSD+ compared to DSD- and AMC cases. FC levels of p75(NTR) and proNGF were increased, while ChAT levels decreased in DSD+ compared to AMC. A greater number of AT8 tau positive neuropil threads and Thioflavin-S labeled neurofibrillary tangles were found in DSD+. These findings suggest a greater role for p75(NTR)/proNGF in demented in individuals with DS compared to those with dementia. The factors that underlie cognitive resilience in DSD- remains to be determined.

An older woman with dementia and type 2 diabetes was started on semaglutide and subsequently developed severe psychological and physical symptoms, including apathy, significant weight loss and decreased appetite. These symptoms markedly improved after the medication was discontinued. This case underscores the importance of recognising potential psychiatric side effects of semaglutide, especially in older adults with cognitive impairment. The experience highlights the need for careful monitoring when prescribing semaglutide in this population and suggests that discontinuation should be considered if adverse symptoms arise. It also raises awareness about the limited safety data on semaglutide in older patients, emphasising the necessity of further research to understand its effects on this vulnerable group.

Dementia is an umbrella term describing different types of diseases that lead to cognitive impairment and memory dysfunction, predominantly affecting older adults. The most common forms include Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Despite extensive research, there is no definitive cure for dementia, primarily due to its complex and multifactorial nature, particularly the role of genetic abnormalities. Gene therapy, a novel therapeutic approach, aims to correct defective genes or introduce functional gene products by delivering specific DNA sequences to patients, and is often considered for individuals unresponsive to conventional treatments, such as those with dementia. Over the past decade, significant research has explored the potential of gene therapy in dementia, offering new hope for more effective treatments. However, several challenges remain in its practical application. One key challenge is developing safe and efficient gene delivery methods, as the brain's intricate structure and protective barriers present significant obstacles. Furthermore, ensuring the long-term expression and stability of therapeutic genes is crucial for sustained benefit. Future studies should focus on identifying genes implicated in different types of dementia, optimizing gene delivery systems, improving gene-targeting specificity, and conducting comprehensive clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of these therapies. Addressing these challenges could pave the way for novel treatment strategies, ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals with dementia.

Neurodegenerative and mental disorders significantly affect the manner of speaking, syntax, semantics and specific habits of word choice. The aim of our research was to develop linguistic speech analysis methods to provide screening tests in neurology and psychiatry as subjective techniques supporting medical diagnostics. Using features of speech samples recorded by the subjects and the control group, we created classifiers which distinguish one group of recordings from the other. We used two methods to diagnose dementia. The first method is based on the observation that people with dementia have lower vocabulary variations. The second diagnostic method is based on probabilities of lemmas. This method was also used in depression screening tests. For neurodegenerative and mental disorders, linguistic analysis appeared to be satisfactorily effective. Linguistic changes were easily detectable in dementia and less noticeable in depression. We achieved a 95% precision of diagnosis in the control group for dementia and 100% for the three stages of depression. This is higher than in groups of patients (dementia 93% and average 70% for the three stages of depression).

BACKGROUND: As dementia is a life-limiting illness, it is now widely accepted that people with dementia benefit from palliative care. The core components of palliative care for people with dementia have been suggested, however little is known about what an effective dementia palliative care service looks like in practice. While some services exist, a lack of description and scant detail on how and why they work makes it difficult for others to learn from existing successful models and impedes replication. Accordingly, we set out to describe an effective dementia palliative care service using programme theory, and to visually represent it in a logic model. METHODS: This was mixed-methods study. An exemplary dementia palliative care service, which cares for people with advanced dementia in their own home in the last year of life, had been identified from a previous survey. The development of the programme logic model was informed by interviews with staff (n = 6), staff surveys (n = 1), service user surveys (n = 10) and the analysis of secondary data sources including routinely collected service data. RESULTS: The logic model and summary results explain in detail how this dementia palliative care service undertook activities relating to person-centred care, carer support, end-of-life care, accessible care, timely care, and integrated care. It maps each activity to specific outputs and outcomes, showing that dementia palliative care, when provided appropriately, can greatly improve the quality of care received by people living and dying with advanced dementia, and their families, in the community. CONCLUSIONS: The logic model presented may support those developing dementia palliative care services, or guide others running existing services in how to systematically present their service activities to others, and demonstrates how clinicians, policy-makers, and others involved in service planning can utilise logic models to design new services and improve existing services.

Caregiving for persons living with dementia has long been conceived as a series of tasks that sustain the body. Tasks such as these describe the work of caregiving for a person living with dementia, but they do not adequately define the practice of caregiving. The central premise of this essay is that caregiving is body care, but it is also mind care. In this article, we describe how mind care occurs within the caregiving dyad. Utilizing the extended mind thesis developed in the philosophical literature, we characterize the dyad as a kind of mental extension. We then suggest that mental extension may also be related to the support of the self and the moral person. We conclude by highlighting how this theory informs dementia care and policy.

The prevalence of dementia is rising globally, with significant consequences for society. This increase not only places a substantial financial strain on caregivers and families but also adds a growing economic burden on societies and governments. In this context, improving the financial capacity of dementia patients is critical, as it can help mitigate the risk of financial exploitation and improve their quality of life. Financial competence is a complex and evolving concept, encompassing specific financial transaction behaviours and cognitive skills, such as mathematical ability and financial knowledge. Some recent studies have proposed a people-centred approach, emphasising that financial capacity should be understood through observation and aligned with individuals' personal values and life experiences. In this review, we outline the definition of financial capacity, especially in relation to dementia patients. Despite the importance of this area, tools specifically designed to measure financial capacity in dementia patients are still limited. The early decline of financial capacity is a common and notable trend among individuals with various types of dementia, underscoring its potential as an important marker for dementia diagnosis. For this reason, it is essential for clinicians to recognise the early signs of diminished financial ability, enabling them to offer timely guidance and support to patients and their families. The present review also provides insights from Japanese clinicians on managing patients who exhibit impaired financial capacity. In Japan, dementia prevalence is rising rapidly due to an aging population, making it critical to focus on research and practical solutions to address the financial challenges faced by these patients. Greater attention should be paid to developing strategies that safeguard the financial well-being of dementia patients, supporting them in managing their finances as independently as possible while protecting them from exploitation.

INTRODUCTION: Disparity exists in early dementia diagnoses by race/ethnicity, sex, education, and rural/urban residence. No data exist on whether Medicare Annual Wellness Visits (AWVs) can reduce these disparities. METHODS: Nested case-control studies included 100% Medicare beneficiaries with a new diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in 2017 to 2020. We examined the association between AWV receipt and MCI diagnosis versus ADRD. RESULTS: Medicare beneficiaries who received an AWV were 13% to 21% more likely than those without an AWV to be diagnosed at MCI stage versus ADRD stage. The interaction effect of AWV, sex, and race/ethnicity on MCI diagnosis was significant. The likelihood of MCI diagnosis versus ADRD was similar between females and males among those who received AWVs. Receiving an AWV reduced, but did not eliminate, racial/ethnic differences in MCI diagnosis. DISCUSSION: AWVs had modest but significant effects in reducing disparity in the diagnosis of early cognitive impairment. HIGHLIGHTS: Data from analyses of Medicare beneficiaries newly diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease and related dementias suggested a positive association between Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) use and early diagnosis of cognitive impairment (CI).AWVs had modest but significant effects in reducing the sex and racial/ethnic disparity in early CI diagnosis.Further studies, including on cognition assessment, caregivers' preferences for AWVs, and the ways in which providers deliver AWVs, will help us better understand the effect of AWVs on reducing disparities in early dementia diagnosis.

The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by profound changes in personality, behavior, and social comportment. Diagnosis of bvFTD is challenging, and it is frequently misdiagnosed as an idiopathic psychiatric disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder) or another neurodegenerative disease (e.g., Alzheimer's disease dementia). The diagnostic challenge is exacerbated by a lack of reliable in vivo biological markers of disease pathology, which means that, at present, diagnosis relies largely on detailed behavioral and cognitive assessments. In this article, we discuss how clinical diagnostic criteria for bvFTD have evolved over the past three decades, and emphasize the diagnostic uncertainty that can arise when trying to distinguish between bvFTD and primary psychiatric disorders or other neurodegenerative diseases. In highlighting the strengths and limitations of the revised diagnostic criteria, and taking into account current diagnostic predicaments, we provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians facing this diagnostic question. Finally, we touch on the importance of early (i.e., prodromal) diagnosis, and explain the utility of biomarkers for bvFTD diagnosis, with a nod to exciting research developments in this area.

Introduction: In the Netherlands, approximately 800,000 individuals act as informal caregivers for people with dementia. Current policies prioritize care within the home setting, often relying on informal caregivers for support, assisted by care professionals. Given the wide ethnocultural diversity among dementia caregivers in the Netherlands, it is crucial to understand how these cultural differences influence caregiving. Given the emphasis on researching barriers to providing care in literature, this study specifically focused on motivators and facilitators to providing care. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews, both with caregivers of native Dutch patients (n = 11) and caregivers of patients with a migration background (n = 9), who all provided care at home for patients with dementia. Data was collected using an interview guide and open, axial and selective coding were used to analyze the transcripts of the interviews in Atlas.ti. Results: Four themes were identified. First, culturally shared motivators to providing care emerged, such as having a unique bond with the person with dementia and themes of reciprocity. Second, culture specific perspectives were identified, with Dutch caregivers often spontaneously reporting considering professional care, while culturally diverse caregivers stressed the available network of informal caregivers and their ability to persevere. Third, personal philosophies on life were a driver to provide care for caregivers of native Dutch patients, while religion mainly served as a source of strength in continuing to provide care in the culturally diverse group. Lastly, adult child caregivers benefit from supportive home environments and from using structure and routine in providing care. Discussion: Our findings show that the decision to provide care often seems driven by reciprocity and the prior quality of the relationship with the person with dementia, contrasting with previous work suggesting that religion is a main reason to provide care. Several recommendations are made how care professionals can take these factors into consideration when assisting caregivers.

BACKGROUND: Timely identification of reversible conditions that mimic dementia is critical in memory clinic practice. However, psychiatric conditions as potential dementia mimics have not been studied as thoroughly as neurological ones, and detailed data on their reversibility remain limited. OBJECTIVE: To identify reversible psychiatric dementia mimics. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on 749 new outpatients to investigate etiologies, progression rates, a neuropsychological assessment, cognitive and functional levels, and potential reversibility, categorized by psychiatric and neurological conditions. Cases showing cognitive reversibility following treatment were also identified. Comparisons were made based on the presence or absence of potential reversibility, as well as actual reversibility. RESULTS: Among the 749 individuals, 121 (16.2%) had potentially reversible conditions: 75 psychiatric and 46 neurological. Psychiatric conditions included depression, schizophrenia and delusional disorders, developmental disorders, alcohol use disorder, and dissociative and anxiety disorders. Compared to individuals without potentially reversible conditions, individuals with psychiatric conditions were younger, had a faster progression rate, and demonstrated higher cognitive function. Of the individuals who had mild cognitive impairment or dementia mimic, 6 (0.9%) showed complete cognitive resolution (3 cases) or partial cognitive improvement (3 cases). These 6 cases included two individuals with psychiatric conditions manifesting psychotic features. CONCLUSIONS: While rare, reversible psychiatric dementia mimics highlight the importance of comprehensive evaluations in memory clinics, particularly for younger individuals experiencing rapid cognitive decline. The infrequency of reversibility may reflect a strong association between these potentially reversible conditions and dementia risk factors, or their role as prodromes of dementia itself.

Globally, 50 million people live with dementia and mostly receive care at home. Urinary, faecal and functional incontinence is common in this population and increases care demands. This study explores care partners' experiences managing continence care for people with dementia in Aotearoa New Zealand. The data are drawn from a cross-sectional qualitative study with 18 care partners of people with dementia and incontinence in mid and northern regions of Aotearoa New Zealand. Participants were interviewed face-to-face from June 2022 to April 2023. Data were analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Six Generalised Experiential Themes emerged. Care partners engaged in autobiographical and biographical meaning-making to interpret behaviours and maintain the personhood of people with dementia, focusing on dignity, identity, and social inclusion. However, caregiving often undermined care partners' personhood due to the physical and emotional demands of continence care. Access to resources was challenging, and healthcare support was often perceived as inadequate. Some care partners' strategies to find meaning and joy in everyday life contributed to resilience, while others experienced stress, fatigue, and burnout. Care partners used personal knowledge to support personhood, especially in social engagement. Uncertainty in managing incontinence led to self-doubt, exacerbated by the medicalised nature of continence care, which involves intimate attention beyond typical caregiving. Timely, credible advice could reduce uncertainty, but many found seeking resources overwhelming. Balancing their own well-being with caregiving highlights the need for support systems addressing the requirements of both care partners and people with dementia.

A descriptive study using a transversal national online survey to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and specifically, the perpetration of violent acts against primary caregivers. 196 responses, obtained in one month, were analyzed. Delirium, hallucinations, anxiety, and apathy were the most frequently reported BPSD symptoms (over 80% of responders). Primary caregivers expressed the highest degree of distress from agitation and aggressive behavior. Moreover, 45.9% of primary caregivers reported being the target of violent behaviors from DLB patients. No statistical association was found between the presence of BPSD and violent acts.

Diagnostic labels aim to classify individuals for treatment in clinical settings. Yet, relatively little attention has been paid to the troubling messaging when a diagnostic label itself carries severe stigma and how relevant stakeholders react to it. Based on twenty-month fieldwork in Shanghai, this article analyzes the adverse effects of the diagnostic label chidai that is used to describe dementia and the relevant stakeholders' responses to the labeling threat. It focuses on the moral context in which the stigma related to dementia unfolds, the power of the medical term chidai in activating stigma, and the efforts that are put into formulating a stigma-free public health message. I found that the label chidai is not only an instance of excess stigma-that discredits one's cognitive capability and deprives one's moral status-but also an instrument used by medical authorities and governments to protect public safety. The debates on the diagnostic labels are meant to reshape new understandings of dementia and to challenge the power of medical authorities who often neglect humanity and care when they form their judgments and interpretations of disease. This paper contributes to the studies of stigma and dementia activism by highlighting the power of diagnostic labels.

BACKGROUND: Stroke and vascular dementia (VaD) are major causes of death and disability worldwide, and there is a complex interplay between them. In this study, we applied the method of Mendelian randomization (MR) and network pharmacology to uncover and elucidate these mechanisms. METHODS: We employed single nucleotide polymorphisms that exhibit strong associations with stroke and VaD as instrumental variables for MR analysis. Our bidirectional MR analyses were conducted using 3 robust methods: inverse variance weighting, weighted median, Weighted mode and MR-Egger regression. Additionally, we performed sensitivity analyses to assess heterogeneity, sensitivity, and stability levels. Furthermore, we curated and screened targets relevant to stroke and VaD and subsequently carried out gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. Finally, network pharmacology approaches were utilized to explore potential mechanisms underlying stroke and VaD. RESULTS: The results of the inverse variance weighted analysis demonstrate a significant positive causal relationship between stroke and VaD (OR = 2.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17-3.61, P = .01). Conversely, no evidence suggests that VaD increases the risk of stroke. Network pharmacology analysis reveals a total of 222 common targets shared by both conditions, with particular emphasis on peptide tyrosine phosphorylation pathways, including those associated with resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our MR analysis is based on available summary statistics from genome-wide association studies to support a causal relationship between stroke and VaD. Stroke may contribute to VaD through peptide tyrosine phosphorylation-related biological processes.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a prevalent form of early-onset dementia characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and encompasses a group of heterogeneous disorders. Due to overlapping symptoms, diagnosis of FTD and its subtypes still poses a challenge. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used to support the diagnosis of FTD. Using machine learning and multivariate statistics, we tested whether brain atrophy patterns are associated with severity of cognitive impairment, whether this relationship differs between the phenotypic subtypes and whether we could use these brain patterns to classify patients according to their FTD variant. A total of 136 patients (70 behavioural variant FTD, 36 semantic variant primary progressive aphasia and 30 non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia) from the frontotemporal lobar degeneration neuroimaging initiative (FTLDNI) database underwent brain MRI and clinical and neuropsychological examination. Deformation-based morphometry, which offers increased sensitivity to subtle local differences in structural image contrasts, was used to estimate regional cortical and subcortical atrophy. Atlas-based associations between atrophy values and performance across different cognitive tests were assessed using partial least squares. We then applied linear regression models to discern the group differences regarding the relationship between atrophy and cognitive decline in the three FTD phenotypes. Lastly, we assessed whether the combination of atrophy and cognition patterns in the latent variables identified in the partial least squares analysis could be used as features in a machine learning model to predict FTD subtypes in patients. Results revealed four significant latent variables that combined accounted for 86% of the shared covariance between cognitive and brain atrophy measures. Partial least squares-based atrophy and cognitive patterns predicted the FTD phenotypes with a cross-validated accuracy of 89.12%, with high specificity (91.46-97.15%) and sensitivity (84.19-93.56%). When using only MRI measures and two behavioural tests in the partial least squares and classification algorithms, ensuring clinical feasibility, our model was equally precise in the same participant sample (87.18%, specificity 76.14-92.00%, sensitivity 86.93-98.26%). Here, including only atrophy or behaviour patterns in the analysis led to prediction accuracies of 69.76% and 76.54%, respectively, highlighting the increased value of combining MRI and clinical measures in subtype classification. We demonstrate that the combination of brain atrophy and clinical characteristics and multivariate statistical methods can serve as a biomarker for disease phenotyping in FTD, whereby the inclusion of deformation-based morphometry measures adds to the classification accuracy in the absence of extensive clinical testing.

INTRODUCTION: With the global rise in life expectancy, the incidence of dementia is increasing, often accompanied by depressive symptoms. Understanding the interplay between dementia and depression is crucial, as depression may not only co-occur with but also potentially exacerbate the progression of dementia. This study employs bibliometric analysis to map the global research landscape, identify prevailing themes, and discern future research directions. METHODS: We analyzed reviews and original research articles on dementia and depression extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection spanning from 2005 to 2024. Utilizing tools such as CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and an R-based bibliometric analysis package, we assessed trends in publication volume, citation frequency, contributing countries, leading institutions, predominant journals, influential authors, and emergent keywords. RESULTS: A total of 1972 publications were obtained, revealing a consistent increase in both the number of publications and their citation impact over the study period. The United States is the country with the most publications and the most extensive collaborations. The University of Toronto and the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease were identified as key contributors to this field. This research area is currently focused on cognitive impairments, the role of gut microbiota, and non-drug interventions. Future directions emphasize the importance of early detection and intervention, a deeper understanding of the gut-brain axis, and the integration of technology in treatment strategies. Additionally, there is a growing interest in the physiological and psychological interplays such as oxidative stress and its implications. CONCLUSION: This study underscores pathogenesis, comorbid conditions, and non-drug interventions as primary research focal points, suggesting these areas as potential pathways for therapeutic innovation. These insights are intended to deepen our understanding, enhance diagnostics, and improve the management of dementia and depression, providing guidance for future research aimed at addressing these escalating global health challenges.

BACKGROUND: There is limited experience in combining interdisciplinary rehabilitation for persons with dementia and caregiver support. AIM: To explore how informal caregivers perceive participation in a person-centred, multidimensional, interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme targeting community-dwelling older adults with dementia and their informal caregivers, and how the programme has influenced their everyday life. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fourteen informal caregivers, aged 45-84 years, participated in a qualitative interview following a randomised controlled pilot study. Transcribed interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in seven categories and three themes: feeling challenged and boosted to face an uncertain future, perceiving supportive activities as sources of both joy and frustration in everyday life and finding relief in recognising their relative's former self. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Combining interdisciplinary rehabilitation for adults with dementia with education and support for caregivers was perceived as viable and valuable for the informal caregivers. They felt strengthened by the rehabilitation and better prepared for their uncertain future. However, participation also challenged everyday routines, but the benefits appeared to outweigh the strain.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To systematically assess the effects of massage and touch on agitation in patients with dementia and to determine the optimal intervention design. BACKGROUND: Agitated behaviour is the most common behavioural symptom in patients with dementia and can seriously affect the health status and quality of life of individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Massage and touch have been widely used as a non-pharmacological intervention to address the behavioural issues of dementia. However, current research findings on the effects of massage and touch on agitation in people with dementia are inconsistent. DESIGN: A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: This meta-analysis complied with PRISMA guidelines, and relevant literature up to January 2024 was systematically retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Clinical Trials Registry, Cochrane Library and four Chinese databases. Statistical evaluations were performed utilising Review Manager 5.4, and the included studies' bias risks were assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration tool. RESULTS: Seventeen randomised controlled trials involving 980 patients with dementia were included. The results of the meta-analysis showed that massage and touch could ameliorate agitation and behaviour problems in dementia. Subgroup analyses based on massage type showed that hand, head and foot massage significantly improved agitation. Massage and touch for ≤ 4 weeks were more effective in reducing agitated behaviour than those for > 4 weeks. Furthermore, subgroup analysis revealed that massages and touch were more effective for individuals with less severe dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Massage and touch in the short term can effectively improve agitation in dementia patients, while hand, head and foot massage can effectively reduce agitation. Thus, clinical nursing staff and caregivers of individuals should be actively helped to apply massage and touch to their patients. However, more studies are needed to validate our results before we can give a more definitive recommendation. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study suggests that massage and touch can be used as complementary treatments for agitation in people with dementia and encourages nursing staff and caregivers to apply massage and touch to better cope with the agitated behaviour of older adults with dementia. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: No patient or public contribution. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024507133.

The rapid rise in numbers of people living with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) poses major challenges to health systems and policy. Although primary care clinicians provide ongoing medical care for 80% of affected individuals, they face persistent barriers to providing high-quality dementia care. We conducted qualitative interviews with family physicians (n = 20) to understand what core outcomes they consider most important and what care processes and systems and policy strategies they propose to achieve them. Participants identified processes and outcomes pertaining to their relationships with patients and families, involvement in overall medical care, and efforts to mitigate harm as key components of dementia care. Participants also identified overarching patient care values: making active efforts to maintain continuity in the doctor-patient-family relationship, communicating clearly, building and sustaining trust, and responding to health-related social needs. Policy recommendations included work to create health care systems capable of providing comprehensive dementia care, full integration of caregivers into psychosocial care and medical management, adjustments to care cadence, and payment models that support team-based primary care. Findings could help refocus care improvement efforts on implementing the vital conditions for optimal health that can be achieved in primary care and sustained through the course of dementia.

BACKGROUND: Erectile dysfunction and lower urinary tract symptoms, from benign prostatic hyperplasia and bladder neck obstructions, are prevalent in men and associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, such as tadalafil and sildenafil, are used to treat erectile dysfunction and may also offer cardiovascular benefits due to their vasodilatory effects. This study evaluates the impact of these PDE-5 inhibitors on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and dementia in middle-aged men with erectile dysfunction and lower urinary tract symptoms over a 3 year follow-up period. METHODS: This longitudinal study analyzed data from 50 million US men using the TriNetX database. Men at least 40 years of age prescribed tadalafil or sildenafil after an erectile dysfunction diagnosis, or tadalafil after lower urinary tract symptom diagnoses, from 2004 to 2021 were included. Three-year outcomes assessed included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and dementia, comparing men on PDE-5 inhibitors to those not on these medications. Propensity matching was performed for demographics and eight pre-existing conditions. RESULTS: The final cohort included 509,788 men with erectile dysfunction and 1,075,908 with lower urinary tract symptoms. Tadalafil and sildenafil were associated with significantly reduced risks of all-cause mortality (RR 0.66/0.76), myocardial infarction (0.73/0.83), stroke (0.66/0.78), venous thromboembolism (0.79/0.80), and dementia (0.68/0.75) in erectile dysfunction patients, with tadalafil showing more significant benefits. In lower urinary tract symptom patients, tadalafil was similarly associated with reduced mortality, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, tadalafil and sildenafil use in erectile dysfunction patients reduced mortality, cardiovascular disease, and dementia risks, with tadalafil providing more benefits. Tadalafil also conferred similar benefits to patients with lower urinary tract symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is a significant global health challenge, placing a considerable burden on caregivers. Dementia literacy encompasses the ability to seek, evaluate, and apply dementia-related information, influencing dementia prevention and care. Interventions aimed at improving dementia literacy among caregivers have the potential to support caregiving by enhancing knowledge, confidence, and coping strategies. However, the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing caregiver burden remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of dementia literacy interventions for caregivers of people with dementia. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials of dementia literacy interventions were searched comprehensively in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science up to July 12, 2024. Trials included family caregivers of people with dementia. Primary outcomes were caregiver burden; secondary outcomes included knowledge, attitudes toward dementia, and self-efficacy. Two authors independently reviewed the eligible studies, evaluated their quality, and extracted relevant data. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 tool for randomized trials. Meta-analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis vers. 3.0, while narrative synthesis was applied when meta-analysis was not suitable. RESULTS: 40 eligible studies, comprising a total of 4336 caregivers were analyzed. Interventions varied in structure, delivery modes, durations, and frequencies and included education on dementia, caregiving techniques, stress management, and communication skills. The findings revealed that dementia literacy interventions significantly reduced caregivers' burden (Hedges' g = -0.446, p < 0.001) and improved caregivers' knowledge (Hedges' g = 0.806, p < 0.001), attitudes toward dementia (Hedges' g = 0.621, p = 0.002), and self-efficacy (Hedges' g = 0.272, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses and meta-regression indicated that the different intervention characteristics influenced caregiver burden, knowledge, and attitudes toward dementia, such as session duration, intervention frequency, mode of delivery, use of technology, total intervention duration, and number of sessions. However, significant heterogeneity and risks of bias were observed across studies. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential of dementia literacy interventions to address caregiver challenges and improve outcomes, emphasizing the importance of structured and sustained programs tailored to caregivers' needs. Future research should focus on optimizing intervention designs, such as session length and delivery methods, to maximize their impact and ensure long-term effectiveness. REGISTRATION: The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (Registration number: CRD42024565023).

Persons Living with Dementia (PLWD), diagnosed or undiagnosed, have high Emergency Department (ED) use. Identification of such patients poses significant challenges for emergency clinicians with considerable downstream implications on patients, care partners, and healthcare systems. With the advent of Geriatric Emergency Departments (GEDs) there is an opportunity to understand and improve care of PLWDs in EDs with effective allocation of resources and the development of novel techniques to better support detecting those at risk, communicating findings, and coordinating care for such patients. Advances have been made leveraging Electronic Health Record (EHR) data to risk stratify patients for dementia in the hope that those at high-risk may benefit from further evaluation. The promise of multiple blood-base biomarkers (BBM) as a future modality to improve detection of those at risk of dementias, will also have the potential to advance the delivery of care of PLWD and their care partners in EDs. HIGHLIGHTS: EDs have an integral role in delivering care for Person Living with Dementia and their care partners. High acuity and fast paced ED environment and other barriers makes it difficult to identify Person Living with Dementia. EHR-based risk stratification algorithms can identify patients at risk for Dementia in ED and outpatient settings. Use of Blood-Based Biomarkers in the ED setting is novel and considerations of its use and implications need to be studied. EHR based risk stratification algorithm and Blood Based Biomarkers when used judiciously have the potential to overcome some of the known barriers to identify and improve care for Person Living with Dementia as they transition through EDs.

The biological definition of Alzheimer's disease promoted by the Alzheimer's Association Working Group's new criteria relegates cognitive impairment to the background when defining the disease. However, cognitive syndromes, as plaques and tangles, are important biological phenomena, are part of the disease and not of the illness, and are objectively investigable. When well delineated, they show a close correlation with brain anatomy and neuropathology and are also few, relatively invariable, well-defined and well distinguishable from each other. Therefore, their detection retains a high value in suggesting the presence of the disease, which still must be confirmed by principle of exclusion.

Background: Dementia is a syndrome with a high global prevalence that includes a number of progressive diseases of the brain affecting various cognitive domains such as memory and thinking and the performance of daily activities. It manifests as symptoms which often include significant mood and behaviour changes that are highly varied. Changed moods and behaviours due to dementia may reflect distress and may be stressful for both the person living with dementia and their informal and formal carers. To provide dementia care support specific to mood and behaviour changes, the Behaviours in Dementia Toolkit website (BiDT) was developed using human-centred design principles. The BiDT houses a user-friendly, digital library of over 300 free, practical, and evidence-informed resources to help all care partners better understand and compassionately respond to behaviours in dementia so they can support people with dementia to live well. Objective: (1) To characterize the users that visited the BiDT; and (2) to understand the platform's early impact on these users. Methods: A multi-method, descriptive study was conducted in the early post-website launch period. Outcomes and measures examined included the following: (1) reach: unique visitors, region, unique visits, return visits, bounce rate; (2) engagement: engaged users, engaged sessions, session duration, pages viewed, engagement rate per webpage, search terms, resources accessed; (3) knowledge change; (4) behaviour change; and (5) website impact: relevance, feasibility, intention to use, improving access and use of dementia guidance, recommend to others. Data was collected using Google Analytics and an electronic survey of website users. Results: From 4 February to 31 March 2024, there were 76,890 unique visitors to the BiDT from 109 countries. Of 76,890 unique visitors to the BiDT during this period, 16,626 were engaged users as defined by Google Analytics (22%) from 80 countries. The highest number of unique engaged users were from Canada (n = 8124) with an engagement rate of 38%. From 5 March 2024 to 31 March 2024, 100 electronic surveys were completed by website users and included in the analysis. Website users indicated that the BiDT validated or increased their dementia care knowledge, beliefs, and activities (82%) and they reported that the website validated their current care approaches or increased their ability to provide care (78%). Further, 77% of respondents indicated that they intend to continue using the BiDT and 81.6% said that they would recommend it to others to review and adopt. Conclusions: The BiDT is a promising tool for sharing practical and evidence-informed information resources to support people experiencing dementia-related mood and behaviour changes. Early evaluation of the website has demonstrated significant reach and engagement with users in Canada and internationally. Survey data also demonstrated high ratings of website relevance, feasibility, intention to use, knowledge change, practice support, and its contribution to dementia guidance.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: People living with dementia experience progressive functional decline and increased dependence on caregivers. This study examined the influence of caregivers' dementia health literacy on perceptions of medical care preferences and advance care planning (ACP) in people living with dementia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This analysis used data from a cross-sectional survey, "Care Planning for Individuals with Dementia," administered nationwide by Alzheimer's Disease Centers. We conducted binary, ordinal, and multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: On average, surveyed caregivers (n = 431) were 78.3 years, had 16 years of education, and were mainly White (88.5%). Most lived with (76.8%) and were the designated healthcare proxy (95.1%), with high dementia knowledge scores (mean = 8.4/10). As caregivers' dementia knowledge scores increased, they were 1.27 times more likely (p = .02) to endorse comfort care. Caregivers with greater knowledge about severe dementia were less likely to need further treatment preference-related discussions (knowing a lot: odds ratio [OR] = 0.17, p < .001; knowing some things: OR = 0.37, p = .006). Caregivers live apart from patients were 2.71 times more likely to know about such discussions (p < .001). Caregivers of people in earlier stages endorsed greater needs for further conversations with clinicians (no impairment and mild cognitive impairment [MCI]: OR = 7.38, p = .002; mild impairment: OR = 5.32, p = .005) and their care recipients (no impairment and MCI: OR = 5.24, p = .02). DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings highlight the role of dementia-specific education in ACP discussions among people living with dementia, caregivers, and healthcare clinicians. These findings are important because evidence suggests that ACP may promote quality of life, reduce iatrogenic harm, minimize healthcare overutilization, and alleviate care-related burdens.

BACKGROUND: Preparing nursing students for dementia care, a prevalent cause of mortality, disability, and dependency among older people, is essential. Positive perceptions of e-health are believed to be associated with better knowledge, attitude, and skills among nurses across various care contexts. However, the relationship between e-health perception and nursing students' dementia knowledge and stigma remains underexplored. AIM: To investigate the relationship between e-health perceptions, dementia knowledge, and dementia stigma among nursing students. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 513 nursing students from a college in Hong Kong participated in an online survey. METHODS: A cross-sectional design. RESULTS: Students had an average age of 20.6 years, with the majority being females (69.8 %) and lacking experience in providing direct care for people with dementia (69.9 %). Most participants were in their first academic years (95.5 %) and had no family members with dementia (92.4 %). Students showed inadequate dementia knowledge (scoring indicator was 64.4 %) and a moderate stigma score (58.9 ± 9.0). Bivariate regression analysis indicated that e-health perception is significantly related to dementia knowledge but not to dementia stigma. Multiple regression analysis showed that being male (β = 0.520, p = 0.01) and having family members with dementia (β = 0.77, p = 0.03) were positively associated with dementia knowledge. Additionally, greater dementia knowledge (β = -0.53, p < 0.005) and senior-year bachelor programme entry were negatively associated with dementia stigma. CONCLUSION: The curricula of pre-registration nursing education should be enhanced to improve dementia knowledge and reduce stigma. The lack of a significant correlation between e-health perception, experience in caring for individuals with dementia, and dementia knowledge and stigma underscores the need to improve the quality of dementia education by leveraging e-health opportunities and clinical practicum.

INTRODUCTION: The prevalence and costs of dementias are rising due to demographic changes. Dementia care depends largely on informal caregivers and fragmented healthcare systems that often fail to meet the needs of people with dementia. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aims to identify unmet needs and barriers in European dementia care, providing a framework to improve health strategies. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, articles from 2013 to 2023 were screened from Embase, PsycINFO, HTA Database, and Web of Science. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used for evaluation. RESULTS: From 3,738 articles, 47 met the inclusion criteria. Through a narrative synthesis, the review identified unmet needs and barriers among People Living with Dementia, caregivers, and healthcare workers. Psychosocial and emotional support are essential for managing stress and ensuring quality of life. Caregivers demand education about dementia care, progression, and self-care, while healthcare workers need training, and interdisciplinary teams. Cultural sensitivity is critical for addressing stigma and facilitating inclusive care for ethnic minorities. Healthcare access remains fragmented, thereby decreasing continuity of care for families. High costs, bureaucratic complexity, and geographical inequalities, particularly in rural areas can be barrier to care for People Living with Dementia and their families. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted social support services, increasing distress and uncertainty. About limitation, publication bias and geographical bias from focus on Europe were possible, potentially overlooking insights from other regions. CONCLUSION: There is need for public policies to enhance education, community support, and dementia awareness, with a focus on culturally sensitive care.

OBJECTIVES: Understanding the timing of service access for persons with young-onset dementia is essential for developing adequate support. This study aims to describe the formal support available for persons with young-onset dementia in Sweden and identify factors influencing its provision over time. METHOD: A prospective cohort study was carried out using data from the Swedish Dementia Registry (SveDem), focusing on persons diagnosed with young-onset dementia between January 2009 and April 2022 (n = 2592). Descriptive statistics provided a comprehensive overview of the population, and Cox Regressions were used to analyse factors associated with the time to receive support services post-diagnosis. RESULTS: Living with another adult and higher MMSE scores were significantly associated with later access to home help services (p < 0.001) and care facilities (p < 0.001). Higher MMSE scores (p < 0.001), older age (p = 0.023), living with another adult (p = 0.010) and diagnosis at primary care centres (p = 0.016) were also associated with later access to day-care services. No significant associations were found between age, sex, medications, care setting, living arrangement, or MMSE score or with the time to access counselling services. CONCLUSION: The timing of access to support services for persons with young-onset dementia varies significantly, particularly for those living with another adult. These patterns may reflect a hidden caregiver burden.

IMPORTANCE: The effectiveness of different approaches to dementia care is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of health system-based, community-based dementia care, and usual care for persons with dementia and for caregiver outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial of community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers conducted at 4 sites in the US (enrollment June 2019-January 2023; final follow-up, August 2023). INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 7:7:1 to health system-based care provided by an advanced practice dementia care specialist (n = 1016); community-based care provided by a social worker, nurse, or licensed therapist care consultant (n = 1016); or usual care (n = 144). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were caregiver-reported Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) severity score for persons living with dementia (range, 0-36; higher scores, greater behavioral symptoms severity; minimal clinically important difference [MCID], 2.8-3.2) and Modified Caregiver Strain Index for caregivers (range, 0-26; higher scores, greater strain; MCID, 1.5-2.3). Three secondary outcomes included caregiver self-efficacy (range, 4-20; higher scores, more self-efficacy). RESULTS: Among 2176 dyads (individuals with dementia, mean age, 80.6 years; 58.4%, female; and 20.6%, Black or Hispanic; caregivers, mean age, 65.2 years; 75.8%, female; and 20.8% Black or Hispanic), primary outcomes were assessed for more than 99% of participants, and 1343 participants (62% of those enrolled and 91% still alive and had not withdrawn) completed the study through 18 months. No significant differences existed between the 2 treatments or between treatments vs usual care for the primary outcomes. Overall, the least squares means (LSMs) for NPI-Q scores were 9.8 for health system, 9.5 for community-based, and 10.1 for usual care. The difference between health system vs community-based care was 0.30 (97.5% CI, -0.18 to 0.78); health system vs usual care, -0.33 (97.5% CI, -1.32 to 0.67); and community-based vs usual care, -0.62 (97.5% CI, -1.61 to 0.37). The LSMs for the Modified Caregiver Strain Index were 10.7 for health system, 10.5 for community-based, and 10.6 for usual care. The difference between health system vs community-based care was 0.25 (97.5% CI, -0.16 to 0.66); health system vs usual care, 0.14 (97.5% CI, -0.70 to 0.99); and community-based vs usual care, -0.10 (97.5% CI, -0.94 to 0.74). Only the secondary outcome of caregiver self-efficacy was significantly higher for both treatments vs usual care but not between treatments: LSMs were 15.1 for health system, 15.2 for community-based, and 14.4 for usual care. The difference between health system vs community-based care was -0.16 (95% CI, -0.37 to 0.06); health system vs usual care, 0.70 (95% CI, 0.26-1.14); and community-based vs usual care, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.29). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized trial of dementia care programs, no significant differences existed between health system-based and community-based care interventions nor between either active intervention or usual care regarding patient behavioral symptoms and caregiver strain. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03786471.

OBJECTIVES: This study presents findings from IDEA Café, for older adults aged 50 and older living with early dementia, dementia, Alzheimer's Disease or cognitive impairment (ED/CI) with no informal caregiver or care partner. IDEA Café is a group adaptation of Innovations in Dementia Empowerment and Action (IDEA) (built upon the foundation of RDAD). It was tested with sexual and gender minority (SGM) older adults, as an underserved population. METHOD: Employing a two-group randomized controlled pilot trial, thirty participants were randomly assigned to IDEA Café (n = 15) or routine medical care (RMC; n = 15). Feasibility and acceptability were assessed. We conducted pre- and post-treatment assessments of primary and secondary outcomes. RESULTS: IDEA Café was feasible (attendance, participation), acceptable (helpfulness of the program), and met enrollment goals, with 85% of participants reporting treatment as helpful. The treatment group showed significant improvement in physical functioning (p = 0.04), depressive symptomology (p = 0.03), quality of life (p = 0.04), and a reduction in microaggressions (p = 0.05) and social exclusion (p = 0.03). The RMC showed no statistical change from pretest to posttest. CONCLUSION: A future randomized controlled trial is needed to test the efficacy and sustainability of the intervention and to bring the intervention to scale.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the burden experienced by family caregivers of individuals with dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) in Bangladesh. It sought to identify the key contributing factors and determine the primary predictors influencing caregiver burden in this context. METHODS: Seventy-five caregivers were selected on the basis of specific criteria. The Zarit burden interview was used to assess the caregiver burden among patients with dementia, AD and PD. RESULTS: A total of 75 participants were assessed, with 50 (66.67%) being female. Most caregivers (40.0%) were spouses. Overall, caregivers experienced a moderate level of burden, with female caregivers reporting a higher burden compared to their male counterparts. Caregiver burden was significantly associated with age and the patient-caregiver relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Greater research focus is needed on caregivers of patients with neurodegenerative diseases in developing countries.

BACKGROUND: In those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, nutritional intake decreases, increasing nutritional deficiency risk. Dietary supplements (DSs) may be an important source of nutrition, but recent insight into their use in those with normal cognition (NC), MCI or dementia is lacking. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design determined prevalence for reported use of 12 DS categories and 19 individual DSs based on co-participant report in 9517 older adult (≥ 55 years) National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) participants diagnosed with NC (n = 5361), MCI (n = 1800) or dementia (n = 2347) in 2019. Multivariable binary logistic regression compared reported DS use prevalence between NC, MCI and dementia adjusting for demographics. RESULTS: Reported use of any DS was highly prevalent (NC: 76.6%, MCI: 73.9% and dementia: 69.6%). For all DS categories and many DSs, reported use was significantly lower in dementia compared to NC. Prevalence of reported use progressively declined from NC, MCI and dementia for 8/12 DS categories, including any vitamin (NC: 71.2%, MCI: 68% and dementia: 62.4%) and any mineral (NC: 34.8% MCI: 28.2% and dementia: 23.5%). This trend was also observed for 4/19 DSs, including vitamin D (NC: 49.2%, MCI: 41.2% and dementia: 36.7%). For vitamin B12 (NC: 15.5%, MCI: 18.2% and dementia: 18.5%) and melatonin (NC: 6.0%, MCI: 7.3% and dementia: 7.9%), prevalence increased from NC to MCI and from NC to dementia. CONCLUSION: For many DSs, prevalence was significantly lower in dementia compared to NC. Reported use of any DS was highly prevalent in NACC older adults with NC, MCI or dementia in 2019.

IMPORTANCE: The neuropathological links underlying the association between changes in liver function and AD have not yet been clearly elucidated. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the relationship between liver function markers and longitudinal changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) core pathologies. DESIGN: Data from the Korean Brain Aging Study for the Early Diagnosis and Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease, a longitudinal cohort study initiated in 2014, were utilized. SETTING: Community and memory clinic setting. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred forty-seven older adults. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Participants underwent baseline and 2-year follow-up evaluations, including liver function assessments and various brain imaging techniques, such as amyloid and tau PET, FDG-PET, and MRI). Liver function indicators [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin] were examined as exposure variables. RESULTS: Higher baseline ALT levels were associated with a greater increase in beta-amyloid deposition over 2 years [β = 0.166, Bonferroni-corrected P (P(B)) = 0.012], while lower total bilirubin levels were associated with a greater increase in tau deposition over the same period (β = -0.570, P(B) < 0.001). In contrast, AST alone showed no significant association with changes of AD pathologies. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest a possible link between lower liver function and the accumulation of core AD pathologies in the brain. These results also support the possibility that the liver-brain axis could be a potential target for therapeutic or preventive strategies against AD.

Dementia has emerged as a growing global health concern, particularly in aging populations across the Americas. Despite increasing recognition of its burden, substantial gaps remain in understanding its mortality patterns, especially regarding sex differences and regional disparities. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the temporal trends of sex disparities in dementia mortality across the American Continent. METHODS: This ecological study used Pan American Health Organization mortality data (2000-2019) validated against national and World Health Organization sources. Age-adjusted dementia mortality rates by sex and country were analyzed using joinpoint regression to estimate trends and detect significant temporal changes. Results were interpreted using annual percentage changes and their confidence intervals to classify trends as increasing, decreasing, or stationary. RESULTS: Across the Americas, dementia mortality trends were highly variable by country and sex. Some nations saw parallel trends between men and women, while others exhibited sex-based divergence in direction or intensity. Despite this variability, rising mortality was a common pattern in many locations, especially in North America and parts of South America. CONCLUSION: Dementia mortality trends across the Americas reveal marked sex differences and regional heterogeneity, reflecting a complex interaction of demographic, social, and health system factors. These findings emphasize the need for gender-sensitive public health strategies, improved surveillance, and cross-national research to inform equitable and effective dementia care policies.

Objectives: The brain network serves as a reliable tool for diagnosing neurological disorders. However, the current modeling algorithms for brain networks often rely on several assumptions regarding the interactions between brain regions, which can be inaccurate. For instance, some studies assume linear relationships among brain regions. Additionally, some research suggests that certain brain regions do not significantly influence outcomes when assessing directional influence between paired regions. Methods: To address this issue, we introduced a novel method for modeling brain connectivity structures that estimates interactions among regions from a different perspective. More importantly, this method considers all the relevant brain regions during evaluation rather than isolating individual relationships. Results: To validate its effectiveness, we conducted extensive experiments using publicly available datasets. The proposed method achieved superior performance across all tasks. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that our method not only excels in identifying various brain disorders but also uncovers new biomarkers, providing fresh insights into neurological disorder research.

The risk of dementia is considerably lower among persons with a high educational attainment level than among less educated persons. This association has been documented across countries, cohorts, and populations. However, several questions remain unanswered. What is the rate of decline in dementia risk associated with additional education? Does the rate of decline with additional education differ across the education distribution? Are there key points in the education distribution that demark changes in the association, such as completing high school? Using the 2000-2018 Health and Retirement Study, we use a functional form approach to evaluate how dementia risk changes with each year of education among non-Hispanic White and Black older adults. We observe a linear decline in dementia incidence with increasing years of educational attainment, both before and after 12 years of education. This pattern is consistent across population subgroups. Additionally, dementia risk displays a step-change decline at 12 years of education, but this reduction is observed primarily among men and White adults. These findings underscore the significance of educational exposure in understanding population differences in dementia risk and future changes in the burden of dementia in the population.

A deterioration in cognitive function beyond what one might expect from normal aging characterizes the symptoms of dementia. It predominantly marks older adults, although it is not a normal part of aging. Dementia encompasses a range of symptoms that can include memory loss, impaired reasoning, personality changes, and difficulties with daily activities. One of the major difficulties that elderly people with dementia tend to face is communicating with other people to meet their daily needs. Diagnosing dementia involves a comprehensive evaluation of an individual's cognitive function, medical history, and other relevant factors. In this work, audio recordings of patients are used for diagnosing dementia at earlier stages. To do this, we take sound characteristics from the audio recordings, such as pitch, variations in pitch, loudness changes, how quickly the voice starts, and specific sound patterns. We then selected the best acoustic features using statistical methods to train ensemble models such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Gradient Boost. In addition to ensemble learning models, certain deep learning models like BiLSTM, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM are also trained with these features. The features selected for training include spectral centroid, MFCC, and fundamental frequency (F0). Further, both the ensemble learning models and the deep learning models underwent random search for hyperparameter tuning, along with regularization and cross-validation, to enhance their performance. It was observed that the gradient boost model was found to perform well with an accuracy of 90.5 % in diagnosing dementia from audio data when trained with spectral centroid, MFCC, and fundamental frequency (F0). Furthermore, the study explores the underlying factors that may lead ensemble models to achieve superior performance over deep learning models in specific cases, even though deep learning models are typically considered more effective for large-scale datasets.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health crisis. The disease is defined neuropathologically by accumulation of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of abnormal tau protein in the brain. Early neurofibrillary degeneration in the entorhinal cortex (EC) is a hallmark of AD and a critical initiating event in the hierarchical pathoanatomical progression. However, the factors triggering initial tau deposition in the EC remain unclear. We propose a novel biomechanical cascade hypothesis, positing that the unique anatomical inferomedial positioning of the EC, including proximity to the tentorial incisura (TI) and other skull base structures, renders it susceptible to very mild yet persistent age-related mechanical stress, analogous to the effects of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury, triggering tau pathology. To test this hypothesis, we developed a method to quantify Entorhinal-Tentorial (EC-TI) proximity and applied it to multimodal imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n=47). Based on this neuroanatomical contact coefficient (NCC), participants were heuristically stratified into high (n=24) and low (n=23) adjacency groups. When controlling for other risk factors, tau PET signal in the EC predicted conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD only in the high-adjacency group (LLR p=0.009, tau PET in EC p=0.036). These findings identify EC-TI proximity as a novel and anatomically grounded biomarker of AD progression risk. More broadly, they suggest a previously unrecognized biomechanical contribution to the initiation of tau pathology in aging and sporadic AD, opening new avenues for early detection, risk stratification, and mechanistically targeted prevention strategies.

INTRODUCTION: Antisocial behaviors occur in dementia, but the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms remain underexplored. We administered a decision-making task measuring patients' harm aversion by offering options to shock themselves or another person in exchange for money, hypothesizing that task performance would relate to antisocial behaviors and ventromedial/orbitofrontal cortex (vmPFC/OFC) atrophy. METHODS: Among 43 dementia patients (n = 23 behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia [bvFTD], n = 20 Alzheimer's disease [AD]), we used linear regressions to measure relationships between harm aversion and antisocial behavior, psychopathic personality traits, socioemotional functions, and vmPFC/OFC cortical thickness, controlling for age, sex, and cognitive dysfunction. RESULTS: BvFTD patients demonstrated reduced aversion to harming others and themselves versus AD patients. Reduced aversion to harming others was associated with non-aggressive antisocial behaviors, psychopathic personality traits, impaired empathic concern, impaired perspective taking, and right vmPFC/OFC atrophy. DISCUSSION: Changes to harm aversion are associated with right frontopolar atrophy and rule-breaking criminal behavior in dementia patients. HIGHLIGHTS: Patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia demonstrate reduced aversion to harming others compared to patients with AD. Reduced aversion to harming others was associated with non-aggressive behavioral changes, psychopathic personality traits, impaired empathic concern, and impaired perspective taking. Reduced aversion to harming others was associated with atrophy in the right vmPFC and OFC, specifically in medial Brodmann area 10.

Loss-of-function mutations affecting the lysosomal protein progranulin are a leading cause of frontotemporal dementia. Progranulin mutations cause abnormalities in lysosomal lipid processing, particularly of sphingolipids, major components of neural cell membranes that play important signaling roles in the brain. Most work in this area has focused on two classes of sphingolipids, gangliosides and cerebrosides. Here, we examined enzymes involved in metabolism of another class of sphingolipids, the sphingomyelins, in both mouse models and patients with progranulin insufficiency. Acidic sphingomyelinase activity was decreased in progranulin knockout, but not heterozygous, mice. This resulted from post-transcriptional loss of acid sphingomyelinase (Smpd1) protein. Progranulin interacted with acid sphingomyelinase in immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, suggesting a co-trafficking role like progranulin plays with other lysosomal enzymes. Consistent with that hypothesis, restoring progranulin in knockout mice using AAV-progranulin gene therapy corrected acid sphingomyelinase deficits. In post-mortem brain tissue from patients with frontotemporal dementia due to heterozygous progranulin mutations, neutral, but not acidic, sphingomyelinase activity was decreased. Neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (SMPD3), the predominant neutral sphingomyelinase in the brain, was reduced in patients with progranulin mutations. A similar trend (p = 0.0586) was seen in patients with sporadic frontotemporal lobar degeneration with type A TDP-43 pathology, but not in other types of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The reduction of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 occurred in frontal, but not occipital cortex, correlating with the selective vulnerability of frontal regions seen in FTD. These data shed light on the role of progranulin in sphingomyelin metabolism and of this pathway in frontotemporal dementia.

We conducted a survey to learn what guides current dementia-related practice to support community-dwelling adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities who may be experiencing dementia in Canada. We invited organizations working in health, disability, or senior sectors in 4 Canadian provinces to complete an online cross-sectional survey between April and July 2023. A total of 173 people completed the survey, representing 125 unique organizations, and nearly half resided in Ontario. The most common support and services provided to adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families were related to residential care, day programming, and group home living. Half of our survey respondents reported that they followed dementia-related practice guidelines. The most common guideline followed and early detection tool used were from the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices and the National Task Group-Early Detection and Screen for Dementia, respectively. Lack of awareness about guidelines and detection tools, challenges to implement the same, and organizational needs for future training and service provision were identified. Commitment to resources to monitor adults with IDD who may be experiencing dementia is recommended to provide meaningful support and service to them and their families.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have become virtually the sole class of histamine-2 receptor antagonists due to their greater effectiveness and general availability. However, concern has been increasing about long-term use and some possible neurological adverse effects, including a link with dementia. Several studies indicate that long-term use of PPIs can raise the risk for both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-Alzheimer's dementia, though there is opposing evidence. Neurological side effects of PPIs are cognitive impairment, neuropathies, depression, anxiety, and hallucinations. The mechanisms are unknown but could be due to PPIs crossing the BBB and interfering with neuronal function or causing systemic deficiencies, e.g., vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is essential for cognitive function, and its deficiency has been linked to dementia. PPIs also cause B12 deficiency by inhibiting gastric acid secretion, which is required for B12 absorption. B12 deficiency causes hyperhomocysteinemia, which facilitates tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, major pathological hallmarks of AD. PPIs have also been found to disrupt amyloid precursor protein processing, mitochondrial function, and neuroinflammation, further enhancing neurodegenerative processes. Experimental evidence indicates that PPIs affect brain homeostasis through inhibition of vacuolar ATPases, modulation of microglial Aβ phagocytosis, and induction of synaptic dysfunction. While the specific molecular mechanisms are unknown, findings suggest that long-term PPI exposure could contribute to neurodegeneration, especially in elderly patients. With increasing dementia prevalence, additional clinical research is needed to ascertain whether PPIs are a causative agent or a contributing factor to cognitive impairment.

INTRODUCTION: Intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization is highly common among women and associated with adverse health consequences that may be linked to dementia risk. METHODS: Nurses' Health Study II participants (N = 14,771) reported adult (age ≥ 18) emotional, physical, and sexual IPV in 2001/2008 and completed the Cogstate Brief Battery 2014-2019 (4/6 maximum assessments). Any versus no IPV and IPV subtypes were used to predict cognition in confounder-adjusted generalized estimating equation models weighted to account for attrition. RESULTS: Mean age at baseline was 61.0 years (standard deviation = 4.6); 46.5% reported any IPV (42.3% emotional, 22.6% physical, and 11.3% sexual). IPV victimization was associated with 0.029 SD unit (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.068, 0.009) lower global cognitive score but not rate of cognitive change. Among IPV types, emotional IPV had the strongest association (β = -0.048; 95% CI: -0.075, -0.020) with cognitive scores. DISCUSSION: Gendered social experiences such as IPV may influence dementia risk. Further assessment of IPV in aging cohorts is needed. HIGHLIGHTS: IPV predicted lower average cognitive score over follow-up. Emotional abuse had the largest associations with cognitive score among subtypes. We found no differences in rate of cognitive score change by violence exposure. Even modest impacts of violence would translate to large population effects. Gendered experiences warrant additional research in understanding dementia risk.

BACKGROUND: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) people are underrepresented in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) caregiving research. This study examines potential factors associated with the health of SGM ADRD caregivers. METHODS: A secondary analysis using data from an online survey with a sample of SGM ADRD caregivers (n = 286). Hierarchical regression models tested associations between health outcomes and socioenvironmental, stigma, and risk and protective factors. RESULTS: Bisexual caregivers reported more stress, albeit better health than gay caregivers. Like bisexual caregivers, queer/other caregivers reported higher global health scores than gay caregivers. However, queer/other caregivers did not report significantly more stress. Transgender caregivers reported lower health scores than cisgender caregivers. Hispanic/Latino (H/L) caregivers reported worse health, but lower levels or perceived stress than non-H/Ls. DISCUSSION: This study highlights factors associated with SGM caregivers' health, which can serve as targets for the development of caregiver supports, as well as further exploration of the unique experiences of SGM caregivers. HIGHLIGHTS: The health of SGM ADRD caregivers varies by sexual orientation and gender identity. Bisexual caregivers reported more stress but better health than gay caregivers. Transgender caregivers reported worse health than cisgender caregivers. Hispanic/Latino (H/L) caregivers reported worse health than non-H/L caregivers.

Dementia encompasses diverse subtypes with distinct characteristics, including cognitive functions, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and neuroimages. Neuroimaging-based diagnosis is advantageous due to low variability and minimal invasiveness, ensuring safe and accurate outcomes. Recently, integrating multimodal neuroimages with machine learning techniques has enhanced diagnostic precision. Especially, graph neural network (GNN) has emerged as promising models by considering connectivity between brain regions. However, current GNN-based methods are limited by focusing solely on local connectivity, failing to adequately capture global interactions crucial to structural pathways and functional brain activities. Additionally, existing methods pose a trade-off between improving diagnostic performance and maintaining explainability, as complex feature transformations across hidden layers obscure model explanations. This limitation is especially critical in clinical settings, where transparent decision-making directly impacts patient outcomes. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a novel method for diagnosing dementia subtypes by integrating multimodal neuroimages, called Explainable Multiplex Graph Propagational Network (EMGPN). Our method employs multiplex graphs derived from multiple neuroimaging modalities, propagating features across brain regions to concurrently represent local and global connectivity. EMGPN subsequently integrates these multimodal features through region-specific, probabilistically derived parameters, thus preserving individual modality characteristics. Crucially, EMGPN maintains explainability through a transparent architecture without hidden layers, allowing clinicians to clearly understand model outcomes. We validated EMGPN using an elderly South Korean cohort across various dementia subtypes. The results indicated that EMGPN achieved an average performance improvement of 8.6 % compared to existing methods, while generating explainable outputs, including region-specific modality contributions and subtype-specific brain region importance maps. These findings underscore EMGPN's significant potential as a clinically applicable, explainable, and robust tool for neuroimaging-based dementia diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Caregivers caring for patients with dementia could experience depressive symptoms, distress from patients' behavioral symptoms, and physical morbidities. Factors associated with a caregiving burden are complex and vary with time because burden is a subjective measure influenced by physical, economic, and psychosocial strain and has an interaction among caregiver resources, vulnerabilities, and care demands. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the association of patients' and caregivers' factors especially the severity of behavior and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and specific activities of daily living items impairment with a moderate or even severe caregiving burden. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 585 patients with dementia who were cared for informal caregivers and were managed by the dementia collaborative care team at Changhua Christian Hospital in Taiwan. Variables from patients with dementia included age, gender, type of dementia, clinical dementia rating, feeding, toilet use, bathing, mobility, getting lost, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory, whereas variables from caregivers consisted of age, relation to the patient, marital status, employment, type of primary care, frequency of care, and caregiving burden. The Apriori algorithm was used to find the association of patients' and caregivers' factors and a moderate or even severe caregiving burden when the minimum support and confidence were set to 1% and 85%, respectively, along with lift > 1. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty rules were found for caregivers with a moderate to severe burden, and these rules can be further summarized into twenty general rules. To further explore the rules containing severe burden, the minimum confidence was reduced from 85 to 65%. Sixteen rules were found with a severe caregiving burden, and these rules were concluded into one general rule. When the caregiver was a spouse who solely cared for the male patient with moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD), the caregiver had a severe burden. Moderately severe BPSD was associated with a high caregiving burden than specific activities of daily living domain dysfunctions. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of BPSD, severity of cognition, patients' and caregivers' gender, relation to the care recipient, employment, and caregiving load were associated with a moderate or severe burden for caregivers who cared for patients with dementia. A severe caregiving burden was occurred when a female caregiver solely took care of her spouse who had moderate AD. Suitable caregiving supports should be provided to female caregivers in order to reduce their caregiving burden.

There is increasing evidence to suggest that vascular dysfunction can contribute to cognitive decline in ageing and dementia. This dysfunction can take the form of a reduction of cerebral blood flow (CBF), a loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) function or a combination of the two. Indeed, CBF and BBB changes may be causally linked, although this possible causality and its directionality are understudied. Appreciation of the role of vascular dysfunction in initiating cognitive decline in ageing and dementia, as well as the mechanisms involved, is important because it opens up new avenues for the development of much-needed therapies for these conditions, which are becoming major causes of death. Here we assess the evidence for the importance of vascular contributions to dementia, draw parallels with changes that occur in normal ageing and discuss the initiating cells and signalling mechanisms involved. We suggest that attempting to maintain or restore CBF should be a central aim of therapeutic strategies.

A healthy diet has been associated with a reduced risk of dementia. Here we devised a Machine learning-assisted Optimizing Dietary intERvention against demeNtia risk (MODERN) diet based on data from 185,012 UK Biobank participants, 1,987 of whom developed all-cause dementia over 10 years. We first identified 25 food groups associated with dementia in a food-wide association analysis. Second, we ranked their importance using machine learning and prioritized eight groups (for example, green leafy vegetables, berries and citrus fruits). Finally, we established and externally validated a MODERN score (0-7), which showed stronger associations with lower risk of dementia-related outcomes (hazard ratio comparing highest versus lowest tertiles: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43-0.93) than the a priori-defined MIND diet (0.75, 0.61-0.92). Across 63 health-related outcomes, the MODERN diet showed particularly significant associations with mental/behavioural disorders. Multimodal neuroimaging, metabolomics, inflammation and proteomics analyses revealed potential pathways and further support the potential of MODERN diet for dementia prevention.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) can lead to pronounced behavioral and psychological symptoms. A 75-year-old woman presented with forgetfulness and visual hallucination, frequently reporting that a man in white clothing appeared and then departed. On one occasion, she knocked on a resident's door in an apartment building, prompting a police call from the occupant. Treatment with donepezil and memantine proved effective; however, the symptoms improved with the initiation of day care. An 80-year-old woman exhibited incoherent speech and developed optical illusions. She occasionally displayed violent behavior at night, asserting that an intruder was present in the home. Two years later, during a nighttime episode, she perceived her husband as a stranger and bit him. The husband contacted the police, resulting in her admission to a psychiatric hospital. Both patients received exclusive care from the neurology department. Referrals to neurologists typically occur when behavioral and psychological symptoms predominate or when families request psychological intervention. Referrals to psychiatry are primarily used to treat parkinsonism. Electroconvulsive therapy is indicated when both symptom types reach severe levels. Neurologists and psychiatrists provide the most effective treatment for Lewy body dementia.

Neurotropic herpesviruses may be implicated in the development of dementia(1-5). Moreover, vaccines may have important off-target immunological effects(6-9). Here we aim to determine the effect of live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccination on the occurrence of dementia diagnoses. To provide causal as opposed to correlational evidence, we take advantage of the fact that, in Wales, eligibility for the zoster vaccine was determined on the basis of an individual's exact date of birth. Those born before 2 September 1933 were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, whereas those born on or after 2 September 1933 were eligible for at least 1 year to receive the vaccine. Using large-scale electronic health record data, we first show that the percentage of adults who received the vaccine increased from 0.01% among patients who were merely 1 week too old to be eligible, to 47.2% among those who were just 1 week younger. Apart from this large difference in the probability of ever receiving the zoster vaccine, individuals born just 1 week before 2 September 1933 are unlikely to differ systematically from those born 1 week later. Using these comparison groups in a regression discontinuity design, we show that receiving the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a follow-up period of 7 years by 3.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.6-7.1, P = 0.019), corresponding to a 20.0% (95% CI = 6.5-33.4) relative reduction. This protective effect was stronger among women than men. We successfully confirm our findings in a different population (England and Wales's combined population), with a different type of data (death certificates) and using an outcome (deaths with dementia as primary cause) that is closely related to dementia, but less reliant on a timely diagnosis of dementia by the healthcare system(10). Through the use of a unique natural experiment, this study provides evidence of a dementia-preventing or dementia-delaying effect from zoster vaccination that is less vulnerable to confounding and bias than the existing associational evidence.

Fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) is linked to dementia risk, but ultrafine particles (UFPs, <100 nm) may be even more toxic due to their distinct physicochemical properties. However, evidence on UFPs and dementia remains limited. This study assessed the association between UFP exposure and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) among U.S. older adults. Using Medicare data, we analyzed ZIP code-level UFP exposure in 2017 for beneficiaries aged 65 and older residing in the contiguous U.S., applying Cox proportional hazard models to estimate AD and ADRD incidence (2018-2020) while considering comorbidities. Among ∼21 million participants for AD and ∼20 million for ADRD, each interquartile range increase in UFP exposure (3701.6 and 3668.5 particles/cm(3), respectively) was associated with higher AD (HR: 1.026, 95% CI: 1.014-1.038) and ADRD (HR: 1.016, 95% CI: 1.008-1.023) risks. The association was linear within typical exposure levels and stronger in individuals with comorbidities. Geographically, the UFP-associated dementia risk was higher in rural areas than in urban areas, possibly due to different pollution sources. These findings underscore UFPs as neurotoxicants and highlight the need for targeted public health interventions to protect vulnerable populations.

INTRODUCTION: Public participation by people with dementia in relevant policymaking has been advocated to improve the quality of health systems and democratic processes. Public officials' attitude is a key determinant of public participation. This study aimed to explore Japanese local-government officials' attitudes towards public participation by people with dementia in policymaking and associated factors. METHODS: This cross-sectional study, utilising an online survey conducted in December 2022, included public officials (n = 997) in charge of dementia policy in Japanese municipalities, with one respondent from each municipality. Participants' certifications were administrative, public-health nurse, or other professionals. Univariate and mediation analyses were performed with attitudes towards public participation by people with dementia as a dependent variable, attitudes towards people with dementia as a mediating variable, and demographic characteristics, contact opportunities with people with dementia, and sources of dementia-related information as exploratory variables. RESULTS: The mean attitude towards people with dementia and towards public participation was 45.1 (SD: 5.1) and 12.6 (SD: 1.8), respectively. Positive attitudes towards people with dementia were a significant determinant of supportive attitudes towards public participation. Participation in collaborative activities with people with dementia and a larger municipality population had positive and significant direct effects on attitudes towards public participation by people with dementia. Additionally, the public officials' sex and exposure to information about dementia directly from people with dementia showed a significant positive indirect effect mediated by attitude towards people with dementia. DISCUSSION: Attitudes towards people with dementia are the most significant factor influencing their public participation; therefore, reducing stigma among public officials is essential to foster public participation by people with dementia. Active involvement of public officials in collaborative activities with people with dementia at the micro level and valuing the perspectives of people with dementia as essential contributions can enhance public participation by in local policymaking.

Digital health innovations hold diagnostic and therapeutic promise but may be subject to biases for underrepresented groups. We explored perceptions of using artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostics for dementia through a focus group as part of the Automated Brain Image Analysis for Timely and Equitable Dementia Diagnosis (ABATED) study. Qualitative feedback from a diverse public engagement group indicated that cultural variations in trust and acceptability of AI diagnostics may be an unrecognised source of real-world inequity. Efforts focused on the adoption of AI diagnostics in memory clinic pathways should aim to recognise and account for this issue.

OBJECTIVES: Limited research has explored caregivers' activities beyond caregiving duties, which may offer positive experiences and counterbalance caregiving stress. This study aimed to (a) identify the most pleasant non-caregiving activities, (b) assess time allocation based on activity categories and pleasantness, and (c) investigate the association between activity pleasantness and duration, considering differences between caregivers to older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and those without. METHODS: This study included 2,136 caregivers (33% ADRD) from the 2017 National Study of Caregiving who participated in a time diary interview. Participants reported all activities from the previous day, including their pleasantness appraisal and duration. RESULTS: Weighted descriptives showed organizational activities (e.g., religious practices) were rated as the most pleasant, followed by active leisure (e.g., sports), for both ADRD and non-ADRD caregivers. Caregivers spent most time on non-active leisure (e.g., TV viewing), with about 10.6 hr daily on pleasant non-caregiving activities and 35 min on unpleasant ones. Weighted linear regression models indicated that both groups reported comparable pleasantness ratings for various activities and allocated similar amounts of time to activities based on categories and pleasantness. For non-ADRD caregivers, greater activity pleasantness was temporarily linked to longer durations. DISCUSSION: This study enhances understanding of caregivers' appraisals and time spent on non-caregiving activities. Although ADRD caregiving is more stressful than non-ADRD caregiving, no spillover effect was observed on the pleasantness ratings or time spent on non-caregiving activities. However, ADRD caregivers may encounter challenges in sustaining pleasant activities over time.

As demographics and gender norms shift, more older men will be providing care for their wives living with dementia than ever before. Research on husbands as caregivers is limited and offers an incomplete picture of their role development and how they experience caregiving. This study examined husbands whose wives have dementia and how they provide care and construct their sense of self. Semi-structured interviews with 11 men aged 61-88 were conducted in Ontario, Canada. Data were analyzed using constant comparison analysis and a constructivist grounded theory (CGT) approach. Two categories were developed: Adapting to the Role of Caregiver and Staying a Husband. Caregiving as a husband for a wife living with dementia required revision of the role of husband to include that of caregiver by reimaging intimacy, being a protector in new ways, and finding new meanings to being a provider and the value of wealth.

People use advance directives to express preferences that direct their future care when they lack decision-making capacity. One form of advance directive, a "dementia directive," records preferences about living in various stages of dementia. This is important because many Americans want to avoid living with advanced progressive dementia. Unfortunately, traditional advance directives cannot dependably achieve this goal. In contrast, some dementia directives can achieve this goal, by directing cessation of manually assisted feeding and drinking.While many dementia directives have been published, most have gaps and omissions that thwart the goal of avoiding extended intolerable life in advanced dementia. To overcome these problems, we formulated a new dementia directive. This article explains the value of this new directive. We proceed in six stages. First, we review the prevalence of advanced dementia. Second, we identify the disadvantages of another option for accomplishing the goal of not living into advanced dementia, preemptive VSED. Third, we distinguish notable court cases where dementia directives were unsuccessful. Fourth, we review nine prominent dementia directives, noting how the Northwest Justice Project's Advance Directive for VSED remedies those shortcomings. Fifth, we review this directive's legal status. Sixth, we articulate its ethical justification.

OBJECTIVES: Emerging evidence demonstrates that multimorbidity, defined as the co-occurrence of at least two chronic conditions, may elevate the risk of dementia especially when certain conditions co-occur. Therefore, we investigated the available evidence on the relationship between clusters of multimorbidity and dementia risk in adults. METHODS: Embase, PsycINFO, and Ovid MEDLINE were searched until the ninth of February 2025. Included studies reported dementia risk or incidence in adult populations in relation to different clusters of multimorbidity. A narrative synthesis was structured according to the identified clusters across studies, their associations with dementia risk, and any moderation or stratification analyses for APOE ε4 allele carriership and C-reactive protein (CRP), among others. The Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool was used for quality assessment. RESULTS: Of the 870 abstracts screened, 7 were included in the final synthesis. Significant relationships between clusters of multimorbidity and an elevated risk of dementia were identified in all studies. The most consistent findings related to cardiometabolic and mental health/neuropsychiatric clusters evidencing the highest dementia risk. Other multimorbidity clusters were less well studied and results regarding dementia risk varied across studies. Moderation and stratification analyses for APOE ε4 and CRP, where available, yielded inconsistent findings. CONCLUSION: This systematic review highlights the importance of understanding multimorbidity clusters for early identification of dementia risk and targeted treatment approaches. Further research is required to explore relationships between multimorbidity clusters and dementia risk across different ethnic groups as well as the potential moderating role of lifestyle factors.

OBJECTIVES: In 2017, the Chronic Condition Warehouse released a 30-condition Chronic Condition file (CC30), which fully replaced the prior 27-condition file (CC27) in 2022. CC30 shortened the look-back period for dementia identification from 3 to 2 years and raised the required outpatient/carrier claims from 1 to 2. This change may disproportionately affect individuals with limited access to health care. This study aimed to quantify how the CC27-CC30 transition affects dementia identification across population subgroups. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Medicare beneficiaries with dementia, including 12,951,241 person-years between 2018 and 2021. METHODS: We linked 2018-2021 Medicare Beneficiary Summary Files (base file, CC27, and CC30) with publicly available data. Beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in either CC27 or CC30 were identified. Disagreement was defined as having dementia in one file but not the other. Logistic regression was used to examine patient-level (eg, race/ethnicity, dual status, age, gender) and area-level (eg, mental health provider shortages, social deprivation) factors associated with the disagreement. RESULTS: CC30 identified approximately 70% to 72% of AD and ADRD cases in CC27, and added very few additional ADRD cases (0.04%). Disagreement (mainly driven by the exclusion of individuals previously identified by CC27) varied by individual and community characteristics. For example, Asian and Hispanic beneficiaries had 51% to 55% and 20% to 26% higher odds of disagreement for ADRD, respectively (P < .01). Rural residence was associated with an 11% to 13% increase in the odds of disagreement of ADRD (P < .01). Residents in communities with higher socioeconomic deprivation and lower proportions of White residents also had a higher likelihood of disagreement in ADRD dementia identification. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Transitioning from CC27 to CC30 reduces identified AD and ADRD dementia cases, disproportionately affecting certain subpopulations. Researchers and policymakers should consider these changes when interpreting trends and designing dementia care interventions.

Receiving an Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis is widely understood as a life-changing event, that is, one that challenges not only memory and cognition but one's sense of identity and agency. By centering the voices of those affected and aligning findings with socioemotional selectivity and continuity theories, the study by Gamm et al. offers valuable insights into individualized care strategies and the importance of emotional resilience and identity preservation in early-stage AD. This commentary situates the study within the broader landscape of dementia care, highlighting its clinical implications for supporting agency, emotional well-being, and identity preservation. It also aims to critically reflect on how coping responses are interpreted in the original study and to advocate for a more nuanced understanding of emotional adaptation in early-stage dementia.

There is growing interest about the relation between exposure to artificial light at night (LAN) and mental health. This study aims, for the first time, to explore the association between LAN exposure and neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with dementia, investigating its role as a potential environmental risk factor. We collected data about 150 patients with dementia in Modena, Italy. We assessed LAN exposure using satellite imagery, while neuropsychiatric symptoms were evaluated through the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), a caregiver-administered questionnaire measuring the presence and severity of psychiatric symptoms. We used logistic regression models to examine associations between LAN exposure and neuropsychiatric features. Higher LAN exposure was associated with increased risk of psychiatric symptoms, particularly in the domains of psychosis and sleep disturbances. Specifically, individuals exposed to LAN levels above the median (LAN median = 26.32 nW/cm(2)/sr) demonstrated an elevated risk of delusions, hallucinations, and sleep disturbances (OR = 2.09, 95% CI 0.03-4.25), compared to those in the "below the median" category. Associations with other symptom domains, such as apathy and affective disturbances, showed weaker associations. Our findings indicate that artificial nighttime light exposure may negatively impact the mental well-being of individuals with dementia, potentially exacerbating psychotic symptoms and sleep disturbances. However, caution is warranted when interpreting these results due to the limited sample size and the possibility of unexamined residual confounding.

The role of lifestyle and health-related factors in dementia risk has been established. However, how a combination of modifiable risk factors, as reflected by the LIfestyle for BRAin health (LIBRA) index, contributes to cognitive resilience to genetic susceptibility to dementia (CRgen) remains unclear. We selected 6774 Three-City study participants without dementia at baseline (mean age = 74 years) and with ≥2 cognitive measures over time. Genetic risk was defined through ApoE-ε4 carriage alone (ε4-carriers) or combined with high AD-specific genetic risk scores beyond ApoE (ε4-carriers/GRS-high). To define CRgen, we modeled and compared the cognitive slopes of at-risk individuals to their demographically similar peers without genetic risk; at-risk individuals with the most preserved cognition were defined as resilient (ε4-carriers [n = 237]; ε4-carrier/GRS-high [n = 319]), and the least preserved as non-resilient (ε4-carriers [n = 866]; ε4-carrier/GRS-high [n = 1249]). Lower LIBRA risk scores at baseline, denoting healthier lifestyle and reduced dementia risk, were linearly associated with greater odds of CRgen, both in ε4-carriers (odds ratio [OR] = 1.11;95%CI: 1.05, 1.18) and ε4-carriers/GRS-high (OR = 1.16;95%CI: 1.11, 1.22). When examining the LIBRA components, cognitive activity and coronary heart diseases history showed the strongest independent associations with CRgen (all P ≤ 0.01). Genetically susceptible older adults can develop cognitive resilience, which may be promoted by lifestyle modifications and health management simultaneously.

Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is an evidence-based, non-pharmacological intervention designed to enhance cognitive function, quality of life, and emotional well-being in individuals with dementia. With the high prevalence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease in Missouri, CST provides an effective approach to address dementia-related symptoms. This paper aims to inform healthcare professionals about the benefits and practical applications of CST, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the cognitive, emotional, and social needs of dementia patients. Despite the heavy reliance on pharmacological treatments for dementia, CST stands out as a viable alternative, offering improvements in memory, language, executive function, and alleviating symptoms of depression and anxiety. CST's adaptability across diverse settings, including community centers, residential care homes, and virtual platforms, ensures broad accessibility. Research and training initiatives led by Saint Louis University further highlight CST's growing role in dementia care within the US healthcare system. Embracing CST in clinical practice is not just an option but a necessity to improve the lives of individuals with dementia and alleviate the growing burden on healthcare systems in Missouri and beyond.

INTRODUCTION: Non-pharmacological complementary and supportive care programs (CSCP, e.g., music therapy) are provided in addition to standard medical care for persons with dementia (PWD). Care staff observations are critical in assessing the clinical impact of CSCP on PWD. However, little is known about care staff experiences of CSCP and what factors influence documentation of outcomes. We sought to understand how care staff in Kentucky describe the clinically meaningful impact of CSCP on residents and themselves and learn what conditions enable and prohibit documentation. METHODS: Four care staff from four dementia care facilities in Kentucky (representing non-profit, for-profit; rural, suburban, and urban areas) participated in this qualitative multiple case study. Participants were selected to reflect diverse care roles, identities, and experience. We collected data from eight semi-structured interviews (two per participant), 24 journal entries, four observations, photographs, and publicly available facility data. The use of multiple data types helped triangulate findings and enrich the analysis. Data were coded and analyzed for emerging themes. RESULTS: Participants described CSCP as enhancing residents' holistic well-being and being person-centered. CSCP also improved participants' well-being and enhanced their sense of purpose. Primary documentation barriers were lack of time, prioritizing resident care over documentation, and top-down regulations. Technology both enabled and prohibited documentation, with routine being a key facilitator. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that CSCP improve PWD's quality of life by fostering engagement, joy, and personalized care, consistent with person-centered care principles. Staff also benefit from reduced stress and improved morale. However, barriers exist, including time constraints and documentation challenges. Results may inform directions for future research, translation of CSCP from research to practice, and feasible measurement of clinically meaningful outcomes. The study underscores the importance of addressing systemic issues and advocating for policies that support sustainable, quality dementia care while enhancing both resident and staff well-being. HIGHLIGHTS: Care staff view person-centered care programs as vital for residents' well-being.Complementary programs reduce burnout and boost morale in demanding care settings.Feasible documentation is crucial to track meaningful outcomes within time limits.Results emphasize the need for policies that support care staff and quality care.

PURPOSE: To explore the experiences of nurses working with persons living with dementia (PLWD) in perioperative settings. METHOD: A study using qualitative description methodology was conducted. We interviewed 20 nurses working on four units in an academic medical center. Conventional content analysis was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Five themes were discovered: (1) Nurses' Descriptions of PLWD Perioperative Experience; (2) Nurses' Descriptions of Caregivers' Perioperative Experience; (3) Nurses' Work; (4) Unit Setup and Patient Flow; and (5) Recommendations for Improving Perioperative Care for PLWD. Aspects that complicated care provision included: neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairment, routine disruption, pain, and insufficient staffing. CONCLUSION: Working with PLWD is time-consuming for nurses and they frequently lack knowledge and skills to provide high-quality care. Ways to improve perioperative care for PLWD and their caregivers are summarized, including through nurses' baccalaureate and continuing education.

INTRODUCTION: Coordinating care for people living with dementia (PLWD) requires understanding which clinicians deliver care and the settings of that care. METHODS: We used the Medicare Carrier file to characterize the settings in which clinicians deliver care to PLWD, clinician types providing care, and whether clinicians record a dementia diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 1,934,318 PLWD received care from 783,225 unique clinicians in 2019; PLWD saw a median of eight clinicians (interquartile range 5, 14). The most common settings were office (74.8% of PLWD), emergency room (63.9%), inpatient hospital (52.1%), and skilled nursing facility (37.1%). In addition, 87.0% of PLWD received care from a primary care physician, 62.9% from a nurse practitioner, and 33.1% from a physician assistant. Of the clinicians providing care, 2.4% are psychiatrists, 1.7% are neurologists, and 0.5% are geriatric subspecialists. DISCUSSION: Care for PLWD must be coordinated across multiple clinicians and settings, recognizing that few PLWD receive psychiatry, neurology, or geriatric subspecialty care. HIGHLIGHTS: In 2019 the median Medicare beneficiary living with dementia saw eight different clinicians. Care of beneficiaries living with dementia is distributed across settings, with large percentages seen in each of the office, emergency room, inpatient hospital, and skilled nursing settings. Primary care physicians and nurse practitioners are the clinician types seen by the largest percentage of beneficiaries living with dementia. Geriatric subspecialist physicians account for less than 1% of the clinicians that provide care to beneficiaries living with dementia.

INTRODUCTION: While wayfinding is vital for quality of life, it is also a declining skill for people with dementia. Understanding wayfinding behavioral patterns of people with dementia helps to improve the nursing home corridor designs to facilitate autonomously conducting activities of daily life. However, a comprehensive image of these patterns is lacking. METHODS: An empirical qualitative study was conducted, studying seven wayfinding behavioral patterns of people with advanced dementia (n = 8) in two nursing home corridors where they live, using fly-on-the-wall observation. RESULTS: The data show that the most frequent wayfinding behavioral patterns observed were "movements" followed by "looking at", "stops on the route", and "verbal navigational cues". DISCUSSION: These behaviors occurred often at crossroads; i.e., places in which participants should make a decision concerning continuing their route. Spatially, these places have high-visibility values and many things to see for people with dementia. Contradictory, these places might cause more confusion for people with dementia. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the design of these spaces.

BACKGROUND: Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are recognized as first-line therapies for patients with mild-to-moderate dementia. However, there is limited comparative evidence regarding antipsychotic initiation risk among individual ChEIs to manage behavioral symptoms of dementia. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate and compare the risk of antipsychotic initiation among dementia patients prescribed individual ChEIs. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study using the 2009-2018 TriNetX electronic medical records data. Dementia patients aged over 60 years who were incident users of rivastigmine, donepezil, or galantamine with a 12-month washout period were included. Patients with a history of antipsychotic use during baseline and 30 days post-initiation of ChEIs were excluded. Patients were followed up to 12 months to identify the antipsychotic use. A generalized boosted model-based inverse probability treatment weights-adjusted Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) model was applied to compare the risk of antipsychotic initiation across the different ChEIs. RESULTS: Among the 7,878 eligible dementia patients initiating ChEIs, 89.40% (n=7,043) were incident donepezil users, followed by 8.13% of (n=641) rivastigmine users, and 2.46% (n=194) galantamine users. During the 12-month follow-up, 807 patients (10.24%) initiated antipsychotics. The CPH model showed that rivastigmine users were at an increased risk of antipsychotic use compared to donepezil users (adjusted hazard ratio=1.45, 95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.88). No significant difference was observed in the risk of antipsychotic initiation between galantamine and donepezil users. CONCLUSION: This study found that rivastigmine users were more likely to initiate antipsychotics compared to donepezil users, while no significant difference between galantamine and donepezil users was observed. These findings emphasize the importance of careful medication monitoring and management to prevent prescribing cascades and reduce related adverse effects in dementia patients.

Age- and dementia-friendliness are major areas of contemporary urban policy and scholarship, seeking to maintain older people and those with cognitive impairment in their own homes and communities. Such work relies on architectural augmentation to maximise the functionality of ageing bodies and minds and has been criticised for conceptualising place as a static unidirectional determinant of individual disability. New materialist scholarship on place, ageing and disability is challenging such conceptions, theorising people and places as dynamically co-constituting socio-material ecologies that co-age and co-dis/enable. Moreover, a critical tradition is resituating dementia-friendliness in the materialising capacities of political economy in everyday public living with dementia. Building on that work, this paper reports on a yearlong creative go-along ethnography conducted with eight passengers with dementia on public transport in Greater Manchester, UK. Through interviewing, multimedia generation and map-making, their stories highlight unequal materialisations of (im)mobilities in relation to the fractious political economies of urban infrastructures in the all-ageing metropolis.

As randomised trials are not always feasible or practical, observational studies remain crucial for addressing many causal questions in the dementia prevention field. Through a systematic search, we found that 84 (72%) of the 116 latest observational cohort studies that investigated factors hypothesised to reduce the risk of dementia (hearing aids, physical activity, antihypertensives, antidiabetics, and antidepressants) used a prevalent exposure design. The approach of using a prevalent exposure design, which compares dementia risk between individuals with and without prevalent exposure at the start of follow-up, has several limitations, including ill-defined interventions, selection biases, and challenges in adjusting for confounders. This Personal View discusses these limitations using physical activity as a case study and describes an alternative approach based on the target trial framework that can help to overcome such limitations. This approach aligns observational analyses with the design and analysis principles of randomised trials and can, thereby, improve the robustness and relevance of evidence for dementia prevention, which is the ultimate goal.

Background: Dementia clinical trials often fail to include diverse and historically minoritized groups. Objective: We sought to adapt the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias-Palliative Care (ADRD-PC) clinical trial to improve enrollment and address the cultural needs of people with late-stage ADRD who identify as Hispanic or Latino and their family caregivers. Design: Bilingual, bicultural research team members adapted study materials and processes using the Cultural Adaptation Process Model. Investigators and research staff held three meetings with eight Hispanic/Latino advisors-seven dementia caregivers and one health care professional. The first two meetings informed linguistic and cultural adaptation of study materials and processes. After piloting the adapted materials with Hispanic/Latino patient-caregiver dyads in the ADRD-PC study, the third meeting focused on refining protocols for recruitment. Results: Key reflections from advisor meetings guided cultural adaptation: lived experiences on dementia caregiving; patient, caregiver, and clinician interactions in the health care system; and limited knowledge and misconceptions of palliative care. Adaptations to the ADRD-PC study materials included specific consideration of preferred language, word choices (i.e., "palliative care" and "caregiver"), and recruitment considerations related to potential barriers to palliative care or research in general. Conclusions: Cultural adaptation of the ADRD-PC dementia palliative care clinical trial protocol depended on participatory methods and collaboration between Hispanic/Latino caregiver advisors and researchers, including bilingual, bicultural team members. Comparable methods may inform future culturally inclusive approaches to clinical research and thus improve representation of minoritized groups in dementia care research.

Tau protein accumulation is one of the characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Their accumulation is driven by the formation of intermediate toxic oligomers of Tau to the highly ordered neurofibrillary tangles. Cellular machineries engage different types of proteins such as, chaperone-co-chaperones complex, ubiquitin, kinases, proteases etc., to clear the aberrantly accumulated Tau protein which otherwise would cause neuronal death. In the milieu of proteotoxicity, it would be significant for the cell to follow a specific path for Tau clearance. Under this circumstance, cells express key proteins and other accessory proteins specific to the pathway. This is known to be dependent on the post-translational modifications and mutations associated with Tau. The processes involved maintenance of proteins homeostasis in cells collectively called proteostasis. The proteostasis involve the synthesis of proteins by ribosomes, protein folding mostly by chaperons and the degradation of improperly folded or unwanted proteins. Autophagy is the mechanism to eradicate unwanted, non-functional and toxic proteins from the cell. Proteostasis plays a pivotal role in maintaining the normal cellular environment in the expense of considerable amount of energy. AD is the prevalent type of dementia associated with aging, which is characterized by aggregation of Tau.

Transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) is a noninvasive neuromodulation therapy with Conformité Européenne (CE) marking for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Initial pilot studies have demonstrated promising effects on cognitive function. This article focuses on the procedure for treating patients with AD using an MRI-guided, neuro-navigated TPS device. The protocol to be followed for this is described in detail, including the necessary procedures and device settings. A brief overview of the representative clinical results published to date is also provided. In addition to significant clinical improvements in cognition and affect, adverse events (AE) and possible adverse device events (ADE) are presented to provide safety data. Finally, the method is critically discussed. In the future, randomized controlled trials should be conducted to rule out any placebo effects. There is also currently a lack of long-term studies with a larger number of patients. Despite these unresolved questions, TPS has the potential as an adjunct treatment for Alzheimer's patients when used in a controlled, scientifically guided setting.

Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) plays an essential role in the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. Defective mitophagy triggered by amyloid beta (Aβ) is linked to neuronal deterioration and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the defective mitophagy in AD is still not fully illustrated. Protein phosphatase Mn(2+)/Mg(2+)-dependent 1D (PPM1D) triggers autophagy in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Downregulated PPM1D was shown in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. This study aims to investigate the role of PPM1D in the progression of AD. Here, APP/PS1 mice were used to mimic AD, and rAAV2 vectors expressing PPM1D were injected into the bilateral hippocampus. In vitro, the mouse hippocampal neuron cell line HT22 was stimulated by Aβ(1)(-)(42) to trigger neuronal damage. High PPM1D expression alleviated the impairments of spatial cognition and memory in APP/PS1 mice. Additionally, PPM1D enhanced autophagosome formation, lysosomal degradation of impaired mitochondria, amyloid plaque deposition, and neuronal degeneration and apoptosis in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Similar effects of PPM1D on neuronal apoptosis and mitophagy were observed in Aβ(1)(-)(42)-treated HT22 cells, and the effects could be reversed by the mitophagy inhibitor cyclosporine A. In conclusion, PPM1D facilitates mitophagy to inhibit the progression of AD-like disease. Taken together, the present work uncovers defective mitophagy in AD may be associated with down-regulated PPM1D, and PPM1D may be a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Prospective cohort studies have demonstrated elevated risks of incident dementia in patients with essential tremor (ET). The explanation for this enhanced risk of dementia in ET is unknown. We aimed to elucidate the underlying neuropathologic features of ET-dementia. METHODS: In a 10-year, prospective cohort study of cognition in ET, we followed participants with detailed neuropsychological testing (assessing 5 primary domains) and assigned cognitive diagnoses (normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment [MCI], or dementia) by expert consensus; brains were collected at death. Participants resided in 43 US states. The detailed neuropathologic assessment included a Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage, Braak Lewy pathology stage, Thal β-amyloid score, and neuritic plaque score. The overall level of Alzheimer disease neuropathologic changes (ADNCs) was reported using the "ABC" scale. Other tauopathies and comorbid cerebrovascular pathologies were diagnosed. During statistical comparisons, we stratified each of the above neuropathologic features into 2 categories: high vs low. We examined how neuropathologic findings mapped onto cognitive diagnoses. RESULTS: The 381 participants yielded 86 brains (mean age at death 90.1 years, 55.8% female). Participants with ET-dementia (n = 40) had higher odds of having severe AD-type pathologies than ET-NC (n = 30): advanced Braak AD stage odds ratio (OR) = 22.8, Thal score OR = 8.0, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer Disease score OR = 5.7, and ADNC score OR = 21.1; cerebral amyloid angiopathy scores were also higher (OR = 4.3) (all p ≤ 0.01). Participants with ET-MCI (n = 16) demonstrated intermediate neuropathology, with greater odds of higher Braak AD stages than those with ET-NC (OR = 8.0, p = 0.009). Other neuropathologies were similar across cognitive groups. DISCUSSION: Our neuropathologic description of ET-dementia shows that, in this sample of 40 participants with ET-dementia, Alzheimer pathology is the prime driver of marked cognitive impairment in ET. Further studies are needed to refine our understanding of the nature of tau aggregation in ET and the extent to which this is similar to or diverges from that seen in AD. One implication of the current finding, which is a more direct link between ET and AD, is that this opens the door to blood-based biomarker testing in individuals with ET who are experiencing cognitive difficulties.

Although studies have shown an association between oral health and dementia, causality and underlying mechanisms remain under debate. Reverse causality and unmeasured confounding factors, such as childhood cognitive function, raise questions about causality. Regarding theoretical mechanisms, essential oral functions such as eating and speaking are rarely discussed. The aim of this review was 2-fold: 1) to explain how recent epidemiologic studies tried to address these criticisms and 2) to suggest future research directions. To address reverse causality, studies used repeated surveys over time. Some studies considered the bidirectional relationship between oral health and dementia using appropriate methods. However, even in these studies, cognitive function prior to baseline was not incorporated. To infer the influence of unmeasured confounders, quantitative bias analysis using the E value is recommended, wherein the E value indicates the minimum strength of an unmeasured confounder needed to invalidate an observed association. Furthermore, methods that can ignore the effects of unmeasured confounding are good options, including fixed effect analysis and the instrumental variable method. However, few studies have applied these methods, yielding mixed results. Regarding mechanisms, although eating and speaking are essential oral functions, they have often been overlooked as potential mechanisms. These functions have a social aspect that facilitates interpersonal interactions and can reduce social isolation. The expert commission reported that social isolation in later life is 1 of the 14 modifiable risk factors for dementia. When we consider multilayered direct and indirect mechanisms of dementia throughout the life course in addition to the previously proposed mechanisms, such as periodontal inflammation, we find that poor oral health possibly increases dementia through social isolation via eating and speaking problems. In conclusion, based on causal inference studies and theoretical frameworks, oral health may be a modifiable risk factor for dementia. Methodologically and theoretically robust studies considering these points are needed to determine causality between oral health and dementia.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Community programs tailored to the abilities of people living with dementia have the potential to address declines in physical and cognitive functioning while also making a positive difference in the daily lives of the caregiving dyad (person with living with dementia and their family caregivers). Unfortunately, these programs remain uncommon. METHODS: This study examined the potential of an 11-week tailored, community dementia program with the acceptability and sustainability of the program being evaluated. The program was held for 3 hr twice weekly, with the goal of facilitating social, cognitive, and physical engagement for the person living with dementia as well as providing a respite period and support group for the family caregivers. RESULTS: No significant changes were found for the caregiving dyad; however insightful information was captured during the focus groups with the family caregivers. From the family caregiver focus groups, four main themes emerged: (a) socialization for the caregiving dyad, (b) engagement and routine fostered by the program, (c) change during the program, and (d) benefits of the program for the family caregivers. CONCLUSION: By using a multimodal design and combining social, cognitive, and physical activity components, the program has the potential for being a beneficial nonpharmacological intervention. Since the completion of the study, our community partner has continued to offer the program. Significance/Implications: The program shows promise for being able to be tailored to the abilities and needs of the caregiving dyad as well as being integrated into existing organizational structures of communities.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) presents a complex spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders, encompassing distinct subtypes with varied clinical manifestations. This study investigates alterations in brain module organization associated with FTD subtypes using connectome analysis, aiming to identify potential biomarkers and enhance subtype prediction. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were obtained from 41 individuals with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (BV-FTD), 32 with semantic variant frontotemporal dementia (SV-FTD), 28 with progressive non-fluent aphasia frontotemporal dementia (PNFA-FTD), and 94 healthy controls. Individual functional brain networks were constructed at the voxel level and binarized based on density thresholds. Modular segregation index (MSI) and participation coefficient (PC) were calculated to assess module integrity and identify regions with altered nodal properties. The relationship between modular measures and clinical scores was examined, and machine learning models were developed for subtype prediction. Both BV-FTD and SV-FTD groups exhibited decreased MSI in the subcortical module (SUB), default mode network (DMN), and ventral attention network (VAN) compared to healthy controls. Additionally, BV-FTD specifically displayed disrupted frontoparietal network (FPN) integrity compared to other FTD subtypes and controls. All FTD subtypes showed increased PC values in the insular region and reduced connections between the insular and VAN/FPN compared to controls. Moreover, significant associations between specific network alterations and clinical variables were observed. Machine learning models utilizing these matrices achieved high performance in differentiating FTD subtypes. This pilot study reveals diverse brain module organization across FTD subtypes, shedding light on both shared and distinct neurobiological underpinnings of the disorder.

The Japan Brain Dock Society, established in 1992, embodies two primary objectives: the detection of unruptured cerebral aneurysms and white matter lesions. In 2018, in response to the needs of an increasingly aging society, the Society broadened its mission to include dementia prevention, adopting the subtitle "A Medical Society for the Prevention of Stroke and Dementia." Although brain dock examinations are not covered by public health insurance and are offered as self-funded services, they have become widely accepted as a form of preventive medicine in Japan. This acceptance is supported by high public health awareness and proactive participation from municipalities and corporations. Among OECD countries, Japan has the highest number of MRI units per capita, ensuring easy access to neuroimaging and facilitating the detection of asymptomatic brain diseases. Consequently, Japan has already amassed a substantial volume of brain dock data. Recent rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are now being applied to the brain dock field, particularly for the early diagnosis of dementia. This article explores how brain dock programs are integrating AI technologies and how they are expected to contribute to the early detection and prevention of dementia.

In this essay, I explore the possibility of meaningful communication and genuine connection within dementia-care settings, and particularly among those living with advanced dementia. Drawing on empirical research and informed by the phenomenology of Bernhard Waldenfels, I aim to challenge dominant cultural narratives that reduce dementia-care institutions to places of confinement and loss. I propose an approach that affirms the irreducible otherness of every human being, including persons with dementia. Through case studies and philosophical reflection, I argue that recognizing the strangeness of both the other and the self can open up mutual spaces of encounter. This, in turn, may cultivate an ethos of the senses: a moral attitude rooted in bodily responsiveness, in which all senses are engaged. Such a responsive posture may not only foster more humane and reciprocal relationships within dementia care contexts but also contribute to richer, more nuanced public narratives about what it means to live with dementia.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) are subtypes of Lewy body dementia, and are considered two ends of a disease spectrum. However, conventional MRI neuroimaging, mainly focussed on grey matter volume and thickness, has failed to establish whether underlying processes differ between them. Understanding these differences could enable targeted and subtype-specific treatments to be developed. We applied quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), an advanced neuroimaging technique sensitive to tissue iron, to examine differences in tissue composition between these Lewy body dementia subtypes. We performed both voxel-wise and region of interest analyses to compare QSM values in 66 people with Lewy body dementia (45 DLB; 21 PDD); 86 people with Parkinson's disease with normal cognition (PD-NC) and 37 healthy controls. We also assessed relationships between QSM values and measures of both cognitive performance and overall disease severity in people with Lewy body dementia. We found that people with Lewy body dementia had higher QSM values in widespread brain regions, compared with cognitively-normal people with PD; and that people with PDD had higher QSM values across many brain regions, compared with people with DLB. Further, we showed a positive relationship between QSM values and overall disease severity, measured using the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale in people with Lewy body dementia, in right thalamus, left pallidum, bilateral substantia nigra, bilateral middle frontal, temporal and lateral occipital lobes, right precentral and superior frontal cortices. In a region of interest analysis, we showed that people with PDD had higher QSM values than cognitively-normal people with PD and controls in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Our findings indicate neurobiological differences between subtypes of Lewy body dementia, that can be detected by exploiting QSM's sensitivity to tissue composition. Based on this, DLB and PDD could be considered as distinct conditions in the clinic and in clinical trials, and may respond to different treatments. Our finding that QSM values relate to real world measures of overall disease severity in Lewy body dementia indicates its potential as an imaging biomarker for clinical trials of Lewy body dementia interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Loneliness is postulated to be a risk factor for dementia. However, the findings are inconsistent, and long-term studies on this association remain scarce. METHODS: In all, 9389 participants self-reported loneliness in the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) in HUNT1 (1984-1986), HUNT2 (1995-1997), and/or HUNT3 (2006-2008) and underwent cognitive assessment in HUNT4 (2017-2019) at age 70 years or older. Logistic regression was employed to analyze the association between the course of loneliness and dementia, with those never lonely as a reference. RESULTS: In the fully adjusted model, the odds ratio (OR) for persistent loneliness was 1.47 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10, 1.95). This attenuated when adjusting for depression (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.95, 1.72). DISCUSSION: Persistent loneliness from midlife into older age, as well as becoming lonely, were associated with increased odds of dementia, whereas transient loneliness in midlife was not. These findings underscore the importance of reducing loneliness. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04786561) and is available online . HIGHLIGHTS: Persistent and incident loneliness was associated with a higher risk of dementia.Transient loneliness was not associated with a higher risk of dementia.Loneliness 11 years before to the cognitive assessment was associated with dementia.Reducing the sense of loneliness might reduce or delay the onset of dementia.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to analyze dementia-related death statistics in Korea between 2013 and 2023. METHODS: The analysis utilized microdata from Statistics Korea's cause-of-death statistics. Among all recorded deaths, those related to dementia were extracted and analyzed using the underlying cause-of-death codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision. RESULTS: The number of dementia-related deaths increased from 8,688 in 2013 to 14,402 in 2023. The crude death rate rose from 17.2 per 100,000 in 2013 to 28.2 per 100,000 in 2023, although the age-standardized death rate declined from 9.7 to 8.7 over the same period. The dementia death rate is 2.1 times higher in women than in men, and mortality among individuals aged 85 and older exceeds 976 per 100,000. By specific cause, Alzheimer's disease accounted for 77.1% of all dementia deaths, and by place, the majority occurred in hospitals (76.2%), followed by residential institutions including nursing homes (15.3%) in 2023. CONCLUSION: The rising mortality associated with dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease, highlights a growing public health concern in Korea. These findings support the need for enhanced prevention efforts, improved quality of care, and targeted policies addressing the complexities of dementia management. It is anticipated that this empirical analysis will contribute to reducing the social burden.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive change is common with increasing age and may generate concern. Two stages of mild cognitive changes have been defined; subjective cognitive impairment and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is confirmed through cognitive testing. Individuals referred to the Landspítali memory clinic and diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment were invited to participate in the study. The aim of the study was to evaluate the risk of individuals with MCI having a disorder leading to dementia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 214 individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment from 2014 to 2017, fulfilled the study inclusion criteria and signed an informed consent and participated in the study. Mean age was 72.5 years and mean MMSE score was 27.5 out of a maximum of 30. RESULTS: Of 214 participants diagnosed with MCI at first visit, 73 (34%) were diagnosed with underlying disease causing the symptoms. Following neuropsychological test battery, 26 (12%) did not fulfill diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment, as they did normal cognition on neuropsychological testing, and did not receive further follow-up. Consequently, 115 (54%) were followed up for one year and 79 after two years. At the end of the study, 47 (41%) did still fulfill diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment but two participants had improved their cognitive performance and therefore no longer diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. Ten participants did not finish the study. CONCLUSIONS: One third of participants with diagnosed mild cognitive impairment were diagnosed with underlying disease and a large proportion of participants were furthermore diagnosed with a progressive disease during the study period. Early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment will be of increasing importance when new disease modifying drugs for common neurodegenerative diseases become accessible.

Approximately 60 million individuals worldwide are currently living with dementia. As the median age of the world's population rises, the number of dementia cases is expected to increase markedly, and to affect ∼150 million individuals by 2050. This will create a huge and unsustainable economic and social burden across the globe. Although promising pharmacological treatment options for Alzheimer's disease - the most common cause of dementia - are starting to emerge, dementia prevention and risk reduction remain vital. In this review, we present evidence from large-scale epidemiological studies and randomised controlled trials to indicate that adherence to healthy dietary patterns could improve cognitive function and lower dementia risk. We outline potential systemic (e.g. improved cardiometabolic health, lower inflammation, modified gut microbiome composition/metabolism, slower pace of aging) and brain-specific (e.g. lower amyloid-β load, reduced brain atrophy and preserved cerebral microstructure and energetics) mechanisms of action. We also explore current gaps in our knowledge and outline potential directions for future research in this area. Our aim is to provide an update on current state of the knowledge, and to galvanise research on this important topic.

OBJECTIVES: Proponents of integrated healthcare systems suggest that such system can improve healthcare experience for individuals with dementia by amalgamating personal and structured resources. METHODS: We assessed systematically available evidence on the current state of integrated healthcare systems viewed in terms of different levels and dimensions of integration, emphasizing multiple stakeholders' simultaneous perspectives. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they (1) evaluated a health system, (2) adopted a network or integrated care model, (3) cared for individuals with dementia, and (4) provided real-world data. RESULTS: Our review included 31 studies. Main components of the healthcare system included care mediation, multidisciplinary care, primary care integration, long-term care, community-based service, digital technology, and one undefined. Most studies involved meso-level integration (n = 23), followed by micro-level (n = 12) and macro-level integration (n = 5). CONCLUSIONS: Key factors that promote an integrated healthcare system for dementia include supportive organizational structure, multidisciplinary collaboration, effective leadership, clear roles, streamlined referral, and community involvement. Macro-level integration should be considered with greater emphasis in conjunction with both meso- and micro-level integration. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Successful development of comprehensive integrated healthcare network will require thoughtful implementation and transition across all levels of the system.

This study amied to elucidate the case of an older patient suffering from aural myiasis caused by Lucilia sericata. An 81-year-old female patient with a history of middle ear surgery and dementia presented with bleeding in her right ear and visible worms. Upon initial examination, a larva was found crawling on the right auricle. Further examination revealed numerous larvae, purulent otorrhea, and active bleeding in the external auditory canal and mastoid cavity. All larvae were successfully removed with ear irrigation. The patient was diagnosed with otitis media and treated with antibiotic ear drops, resulting in significant clinical improvement. The larvae were later identified morphologically as Lucilia sericata, a species of Calliphoridae. This case highlights the potential for aural myiasis in elderly patients with dementia and otitis media, who may be at increased risk for the condition.

OBJECTIVE: Hyperorality is a core feature of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD); however, the cognitive, psychiatric, and neuroanatomical correlates of hyperorality across the bvFTD stages remain unclear. The authors explored these associations in early- and advanced-stage bvFTD. METHODS: Participants with sporadic or genetic bvFTD were enrolled in the ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ALLFTD) consortium study. Baseline cognitive and psychiatric symptoms of participants with or without hyperorality were compared after stratification by disease severity. Linear multivariable regressions adjusted for age and total intracranial volume were used to examine associations between regional gray matter volume (GMV) and hyperorality status. Five anatomical regions of interest were preselected for analysis on the basis of previously identified neuroanatomical correlates of hyperorality in bvFTD. RESULTS: Hyperorality was present in 50% of early-stage bvFTD participants (N=136) and was associated with higher rates of ritualistic-compulsive behavior and difficulty detecting social-emotional expressions. Hyperorality was present in 63% of advanced-stage participants (N=208) and was associated with higher rates of apathy, ritualistic-compulsive behavior, and socially aberrant behavior. Regional GMV was similar for those with or without hyperorality among early-stage participants. Among advanced-stage participants, hyperorality was associated with lower GMV in the right dorsal and ventral striatum. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperorality emerged early in bvFTD and was accompanied by deficits in social cognition and complex-ritualistic behavior before clinically significant GMV loss. These findings suggest that early identification and management of hyperorality could improve neuropsychiatric trajectories in bvFTD.

BACKGROUND: Compared to other racial/ethnic groups, Black Americans show accelerated brain aging beginning in midlife and exhibit higher rates and earlier onset of dementia. While these patterns are often viewed as evidence that Black Americans are more vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease, another possibility is that their high risk for chronic vascular pathologies such as high blood pressure and diabetes compromises their brain health. This hypothesis was tested in the present study. METHODS: Participants included 252 middle-aged Black Americans enrolled in the Family and Community Health Study and living in Iowa or Georgia who had ascertainment of diabetes and hypertension in 2008 and blood drawn in 2008 and 2019. Linear regression models assessed whether hypertension and diabetes were associated with change in neurofilament light chain (NfL), a non-specific biomarker of brain pathology including vascular dementia, and phosphorylated tau181 (p-Tau181), a biomarker of underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. RESULTS: Having a diagnosis of either hypertension or diabetes during middle age was not associated with levels of either p-Tau181 or NfL. However, having a diagnosis of both hypertension and diabetes was robustly associated with higher levels of NfL and increases in NfL over an 11-year period. CONCLUSIONS: Among Black Americans, comorbid hypertension and diabetes contribute to higher levels of serum NfL, our indicator of neurodegeneration, during late middle age but not with p-Tau181, our indicator of Alzheimer's disease. Rather than being instances of AD, elevated rates of dementia among Black Americans may be largely vascular pathology caused by high rates of diabetes and high blood pressure.

IMPORTANCE: Poor cardiometabolic health is a risk factor associated with cognitive impairment in later life, but it remains unclear whether cardiometabolic trajectories can serve as early markers associated with dementia. OBJECTIVE: To compare cardiometabolic trajectories that precede dementia diagnosis with those among individuals without dementia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case-control study analyzed a sample drawn from community-dwelling participants in the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study. Recruitment through primary care physicians occurred between March 2010 and December 2014, with participants followed up for a maximum of 11 years. Dementia cases were matched on sociodemographic characteristics and time of diagnosis to dementia-free controls. Data analysis was performed between February and June 2024. EXPOSURES: Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glucose levels, high- and low-density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL) and total cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels were measured repeatedly between 2010 and 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Dementia (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fourth Edition] criteria) was adjudicated by an international expert panel. RESULTS: Among 5390 participants (mean [SD] age, 76.9 [4.8] years; 2915 women [54.1%]), there were 2655 individuals (49.3%) with less than 12 years of education. The study included 1078 dementia cases and 4312 controls. Up to a decade before diagnosis, dementia cases compared with controls had lower BMI for all years from -7 years (marginal estimate, 27.52 [95% CI, 27.24 to 27.79] vs 28.00 [95% CI, 27.86 to 28.14]; contrast P = 002) to 0 years (marginal estimate, 26.09 [95% CI, 25.81 to 26.36] vs 27.22 [95% CI, 27.09 to 27.36]; contrast P < .001) and lower waist circumference for all years from -10 years (marginal estimate, 95.45 cm [95% CI, 94.33 to 96.57 cm] vs 97.35 cm [95% CI, 96.79 to 97.92 cm]; contrast P = .003) to 0 years (marginal estimate, 93.90 [95% CI, 93.15 cm to 94.64 cm] vs 96.67 cm [95% CI, 96.30 to 97.05 cm]; contrast P < .001); cases also had a faster decline in BMI (linear change β, -0.13 [95% CI, -0.19 to -0.08]) and waist circumference (linear change β, -0.30 cm [95% CI, -0.51 to -0.08 cm]). Compared with controls, cases generally had higher HDL levels, in particular from 5 years (marginal estimate, 62.57 mg/dL [95% CI, 61.59 to 63.56 mg/dL] vs 60.84 mg/dL [95% CI, 60.35 to 61.34 mg/dL]; contrast P = .002) to 3 years (marginal estimate, 62.78 mg/dL [95% CI, 61.82 to 63.74 mg/dL] vs 61.08 mg/dL [95% CI, 60.60 to 61.56 mg/dL]; contrast P = .002) before dementia but with a decline in levels just before diagnosis (linear change β, -0.47 mg/dL [95% CI, -0.86 to -0.07 mg/dL]). Dementia cases had lower systolic blood pressure and triglyceride levels in the decade before diagnosis and higher LDL and total cholesterol levels, but these were not significantly different from controls. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study of older individuals, decline in BMI, waist circumference, and HDL occurred up to a decade before dementia diagnosis. These findings provide insights into cardiometabolic changes preceding dementia and the potential for early monitoring and intervention.

INTRODUCTION: Despite the influence of caregivers' prognostic understanding (PU) on the end-of-life care for persons with dementia (PwDs), the literature on PU of caregivers of PwDs is sparse. We conducted a scoping review to understand the variation in existing definitions and measurement of caregivers' PU for PwDs. We also aimed to synthesize the prevalence of caregivers' correct PU and the factors (caregiver, PwD and healthcare related) associated with it. METHODS: We systematically searched four databases-MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and CINAHL. We included studies where study participants were informal caregivers, their PU was assessed, and measurement tool was implicitly described. We excluded studies where study participants were paid caregivers. RESULTS: Out of the 2160 studies screened, we included 15 published between 2009 and 2023. The included studies measured caregivers' PU as limited estimated life expectancy, understanding that dementia is incurable and life-limiting. Estimated life expectancy was the most common measure of PU among caregivers to PwDs. Across studies, around 90% of caregivers acknowledged dementia as incurable, while only about 40% acknowledged it as life-limiting. Caregivers of PwDs who were sicker (acute medical problems or functional dependence) and those who had discussed goals of care with healthcare providers were more likely to have more accurate PU for PwDs. Caregivers' with better PU were more likely to state a preference for comfort-focused care, and their PwDs were likely to receive fewer burdensome interventions and experience greater comfort during the dying process. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the need for a comprehensive measure to assess the multifaceted nature of caregivers' PU, delve deeper into factors influencing caregivers' PU, and explore its impact on caregivers themselves.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a global issue, with increasing incidence and prevalence as the world's population ages and life expectancy increases. Projections indicate that by 2050, over 150 million individuals worldwide will be personally living with AD, an impending crisis made worse by the absence of cure therapies. Moreover, the risk factor relationship of dementia with rising global temperatures and air pollution further necessitates the urgency of a coordinated international response. With an extensive economic and emotional burden, AD is no longer just a disease; it is a worldwide societal crisis. This review presents five calls to action to address the AD global health emergency. First, AD research must be approached as an internationally performed activity, involving standardized data sharing, collaborative innovation, and improved access to pharmaceutical studies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), alongside increased diversity, inclusion, and equity in research. Second, there must be a commitment to develop universally accessible, affordable, and non-invasive diagnostic tools for AD. Third, advancements in AD therapeutics should prioritize the development of affordable agents, allowing for widespread geographic distribution. Fourth, we identify focus areas for global dementia risk reduction: sleep, head injury prevention, exercise, learning, and diet (SHIELD risk reduction strategy). Fifth, improving care for individuals with AD requires eliminating stigma through educational programs for both the public and caregivers. The escalating AD crisis demands an unprecedented global coalition in research, diagnostics, therapeutics, prevention, and education to avoid a future where the disease becomes the defining crisis of our era.

Genetic studies can offer powerful insights for the development of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease. Protective genetic variants that delay the onset of cognitive impairment have been found in people with sporadic Alzheimer's disease and in carriers of mutations that usually cause autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease in mid-life. The study of families who carry autosomal dominant mutations provides a unique opportunity to uncover genetic modifiers of disease progression, including rare variants in genes such as APOE and RELN. Understanding how these variants confer protection can help identify the biological pathways that contribute to cognitive resilience, such as the heparan-sulphate proteoglycan-APOE receptor pathway, the TREM-2-driven signalling pathways in the microglia, and phagocytosis. Therapies able to replicate the beneficial effects of these natural defences could provide novel strategies for slowing or preventing the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

Actin, a ubiquitous and highly conserved cytoskeletal protein, plays a pivotal role in various cellular functions such as structural support, facilitating cell motility, and contributing to the dynamic processes of synaptic function. Apart from its established role in inducing morphological changes, recent developments in the field indicate an active involvement of actin in modulating both the structure and function of pre- and postsynaptic terminals. Within the presynapse, it is involved in the organization and trafficking of synaptic vesicles, contributing to neurotransmitter release. In the postsynapse, actin dynamically modulates dendritic spines, influencing the postsynaptic density organization and anchoring of neurotransmitter receptors. In addition, the dynamic interplay of actin at the synapse underscores its essential role in regulating neural communication. This review strives to offer a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in understanding the multifaceted role of the actin cytoskeleton in synaptic functions. By emphasizing its aberrant regulation, we aim to provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.

BACKGROUND: Arts-in-health interventions increasingly demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness in improving anxiety and wellbeing outcomes through engagement by hospital inpatients with dementia. We aimed to demonstrate the practicality of digital and traditional group artmaking and understand potential impact on patient anxiety and wellbeing. METHODS: The 3-arm controlled study design included control, traditional artmaking and digital artmaking groups. Outcome measures were State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Generic Wellbeing Questionnaire and Observational Measure of Engagement. RESULTS: We measured a decline in anxiety among the traditional art group (n = 30), with no change among the digital artmaking group (n = 30) or control group (n = 30). We measured positive wellbeing among both intervention groups, but not the control group. Engagement attitude was more positive in the traditional group than the digital group. CONCLUSIONS: We found that group arts engagement was a feasible and promising intervention. We raise further questions for expanded uses of digital tablets in activities for hospital inpatients with dementia.

BACKGROUND: Underlying medical conditions may explain inconsistent reports of the association between sex and dementia risk. The current study aimed to explore the association between sex and the risk of incident dementia, considering a broad range of medical conditions. METHODS: This prospective national birth cohort study consisted of 53,224 members of a nonprofit health maintenance organization. Participants were born between 1922 and 1946 and entered the cohort on January 1, 2002, aged 55 to 80, without a dementia diagnosis. The cohort was followed up for 18 years to January 1, 2020. Dementia was ascertained based on medical diagnoses. Cox regression models were fitted to quantify the association between sex and the risk of incident dementia with hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI), unadjusted and, in the primary model, adjusted for background demographic factors and 33 medical conditions, classified as ten medical domains. Complementary analyses examined adjustment for each medical domain, and sensitivity analyses provided sex-specific estimates for each demographic or medical domain. RESULTS: The analytic cohort of 53,224 participants had a mean (SD) age at cohort entry of 64.3 (7.08) years (Males: N = 24,489; 46.01%; M=63.47 (6.39); Females: N = 28,735; 53.99%; M=64.35 (6.78)). During follow-up, 8,373 participants (15.73%) were diagnosed with dementia (Females: 17.36%; N = 4,987; Males: 13.83%; N = 3,386). Sex differences in the risk of dementia were null after adjustment for demographic factors and medical conditions (unadjusted HR = 1.08 [95% CI = 1.03-1.13, P = 0.001]; adjusted HR = 1.02 [95% CI, 0.97-1.08; p = 0.38]). Complementary analyses showed that when accounting for some conditions (i.e., circulatory, respiratory, metabolic, digestive, or nervous system diseases; cancer; and injuries), females were at an elevated dementia risk compared to males. However, after accounting for rheumatic and genitourinary diseases, the association between sex and dementia was attenuated to null, and when accounting for psychiatric disorders, males were at greater risk. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective birth cohort, the association between sex and the risk of incident dementia changed when background medical conditions were considered, possibly explaining previous inconsistent reports. Future dementia risk and prevention studies may wish to adequately explore sex differences in medical history.

INTRODUCTION: We conducted a virtual iSupport Program intervention for carers of people living with dementia (PLWD). METHODS: We applied a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to evaluate a multicomponent program delivered virtually in four organizations (July 2022 to December 2024). The primary outcome was quality of life (QoL) of carers and PLWD at 12 months post-baseline, and the secondary outcomes were carers' self-efficacy, social support, reactions to behavior, PLWD's behavior frequency, hospital admissions, and emergency department presentations. RESULTS: One hundred forty-nine carers enrolled in the study. The intervention group reported increased mental-health-related QoL points of 12.0 (p < 0.001), self-efficacy points of 14.8 to 18.5 (p < 0.001), social support points of 0.25 (p < 0.028), reduced reactions to behavior points of -0.25 (p < 0.028), and a 60% lower hospital admission rate (p = 0.045) at 12 months compared with the usual care group. DISCUSSION: The virtual iSupport Program showed benefits for both carers and PLWD in a 12-month intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12622000199718. HIGHLIGHTS: A total of 149 dementia carers participated in the virtual iSupport program intervention trial. The program included skills training, peer support, and access to care services. The program improved mental health-related quality of life for carers. The program improved self-efficacy, social support, and reduced distress for carers. The program reduced 60% hospital admission rate for people with dementia.

A right-handed woman in her early 50s presented with progressive language difficulties with visual and auditory hallucinations. Upper motor neuron signs were present without lower motor neuron signs, insufficient to make a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). MRI showed bilateral superior temporal atrophy (right>left) and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emmission tomography (FDG-PET) scan showed right temporal hypometabolism. Her clinical diagnosis was atypical or mixed language variant frontotemporal dementia (FTD) given the presence of agrammatism and phonemic intrusions. There was a family history of FTD and ALS. Genetic testing revealed a homozygous optineurin (OPTN) mutation. She experienced progressive auditory agnosias including musical agnosia and eventual mutism. A review of the literature reveals wide phenotypic variability of people with OPTN variants, emphasising the importance of genetic testing beyond that predicted by classical phenotypes.

The pathway to a diagnosis of dementia and post-diagnostic support can be complicated for people living with dementia and their support networks, leading to delays in care. This paper describes the development and subsequent pilot of a specialist dementia nurse role named the Dementia Liaison Officer (DEMLO) within a tertiary Victorian hospital. The aim of the DEMLO was to identify and address gaps in dementia care. This pilot is based on the principles of the National Comprehensive Dementia Centre framework. Mapping of current outpatient diagnostic and post-diagnostic services for people with suspected cognitive impairment was conducted to identify gaps in care. Interviews with 25 hospital staff were also conducted to gain further perspectives on barriers to diagnostic and post-diagnostic care and inform the development of the DEMLO role. Several challenges to diagnostic/post-diagnostic support were identified, including the perception that waitlists were long, confusing referral criteria, and complex referral processes. The DEMLO was subsequently developed and trialled within the Geriatric Evaluation and Management (GEM) outpatient service. Three key functions were implemented: reviews of eligibility criteria for patients with cognitive impairment on the GEM clinic waitlist, introduction of a pre-clinic comprehensive geriatric assessment for GEM clinic patients and the introduction of a dementia post-diagnostic support service for all patients across the hospital. Challenges to developing and sustaining the pilot included limited timeframe, difficulty with integration and limited funding. Despite this, the pilot was well received, with 141 patients referred. The introduction of a nurse-led dementia intervention has resulted in increased person-centred care that encompasses pre-diagnostic and post-diagnostic support for people living with dementia. Evaluation of the pilot is ongoing.

BACKGROUND: The association between the risk of dementia and different classes of antidepressants, as well as the potential influence of treatment resistance or response, remains unexplored in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 30,390 patients with MDD and 24,312 well-matched controls were enrolled between 2002 and 2004. We stratified the antidepressant-resistant depression (ART, n = 6,078) and antidepressant-responsive depression (ARP, n = 24,312) groups. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus non-SSRIs, was included as a stratification factor. The risks of dementia were examined using a Cox regression model (reported as hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval). RESULTS: Both the ART and ARP groups had a 5-24 fold higher risk of developing dementia than the controls. ART appeared to be associated with a higher risk of developing dementia than ARP, including any dementia (13.02 [11.08-15.31] versus 7.70 [6.63-8.94] and unspecified dementia 12.81 [10.52-15.59] versus 7.33 [6.11-8.79]). Subsequent analysis demonstrated that in the ART group, individuals who were resistant to SSRIs only (12.01 [10.02-14.40]) or both SSRIs and non-SSRIs (13.87 [11.67-16.47]) appeared to have a higher risk of developing any dementia than the ARP group (7.70 [6.63-8.94]). With the ARP as reference group, patients who were only resistant to SSRIs and those who were resistant to both SSRIs and non-SSRIs had a higher risk of developing any dementia. CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients with MDD, the risk of dementia is higher among those who are resistant to any type of antidepressant medication.

INTRODUCTION: Metamemory is the ability to monitor and control one's own memory. The objective of our study was to investigate the estimated and actual performance of metamemory in older adults with dementia compared with healthy older controls. In addition, we examined whether cognition, awareness, neuropsychiatric symptoms, functionality, and executive functions influence metamemory functioning. METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional evaluation of 126 participants. Memory and metamemory were assessed in each group and compared using a memory test combined with a prediction task administered before and after exposure to the scale. RESULTS: Individuals with dementia presented impaired metamemory functioning in both short- and long-term memory evaluations. There was a general disconnect between perceived and actual performance across both groups, albeit to a lesser extent in the control group. In the control group, we found impaired metamemory when evaluating short-term memory. However, no alterations in metamemory were observed regarding long-term memory after this group had been exposed to the task. Regression analysis revealed that only awareness influenced metamemory when associated with short-term memory. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with dementia tend to present impaired metamemory functioning, and awareness of disease appears to be a factor that can influence this impairment.

The global prevalence of dementia is increasing. With no widely available and accessible treatments to halt or reverse the progression of dementia, exploring preventative strategies is critical. Lifestyle-based interventions show promise in preventing or delaying dementia onset. However, understanding the complex and multifactorial mechanisms underlying dementia, and how interventions target these pathways, is essential for developing personalized and effective strategies. In this review, we examined the current evidence of the mediating pathways in dementia risk reduction. We focused on mechanisms investigated in single-domain interventions on physical exercise, cognitive training, diet, metabolic/cardiovascular or psycho-social risk factors in line with those combined in the landmark FINGER trial. Additionally, we synthesized existing literature on mechanisms of action in multimodal interventions combining multiple lifestyle changes. Most evidence was identified in relation to neuroimaging biomarkers with positive effects for all intervention components. The evidence among fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) (amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ), tau and neurofilament light chain (Nfl)) vascular markers, inflammatory markers, and neurotrophins were less conclusive, though physical exercise consistently appeared to impact several of these pathways. The findings of this review underscore the potential of lifestyle-based interventions in modulating several different types of pathophysiological pathways associated with dementia. As the number of dementia cases reach epidemic proportions, a multifaceted approach is needed. We propose that the next critical step in dementia prevention/risk reduction is to refine existing intervention tools and develop an adaptive platform that integrates different lifestyle interventions tailored to individual risk profiles and needs. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and biomarkers related to modifiable risk factors will be instrumental to optimising these interventions.

BACKGROUND: The objective is to identify risk factors that contribute to sex differences in Alzheimer dementia (AD) patients with encephalopathy (ADEN) and determine whether these factors are different between male and female ADEN patients. This is the first large-scale study comparing sex-specific ADEN risk profiles. METHODS: Our retrospective cohort study analyzed data collected from February 2016 to August 2020. It included a total of 128,769 AD patients, among whom 41,266 AD patients also presented with encephalopathy, compared to 87,503 AD patients that did not. The univariate analysis was used to determine differences in risk factors for male and female AD patients. Multivariate analysis predicted specific risk factors associated with male and female ADEN patients. RESULT: In the adjusted analysis, males presented with hypertension (OR = 1.144, 95% CI, 1.094-1.197, p < 0.001), peripheral vascular disease (OR = 1.606, 95% CI, 1.485-1.737, p < 0.001), atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.555, 95% CI, 1.443-1.676, p < 0.001), hallucinations (OR = 1.406, 95% CI, 1.119-1.766, p = 0.003), and traumatic head injury (OR = 3.211, 95% CI, 2.346-4.395, p < 0.001). Females presented with osteoporosis (OR = 0.307, 95% CI, 0.278-0.340, p < 0.001), unspecified cancer (OR = 0.615, 95% CI, 0.512-0.740, p < 0.001), anxiety (OR = 0.609, 95% CI, 0.565-0.655, p < 0.001), urinary tract infections (UTI) (OR = 0.451, 95% CI, 0.423-0.481, p < 0.001), upper respiratory infections (URI) (OR = 0.531, 95% CI, 0.432-0.653, p < 0.001) and gastrointestinal ulceration (OR = 0.338, 95% CI, 0.269-0.424, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our analysis identified risk factors that contribute to sex differences in ADEN. This difference was fully mediated by peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, hallucinations, and traumatic head injury for males and unspecified cancer, anxiety, urinary tract infections, upper respiratory infections, and gastrointestinal ulceration for females. These findings provide valuable insights into the risk factors that can be managed to improve the care of male and female ADEN patients.

Although there are many methods available in the literature to compare the covariance structures of two populations, few are suitable for clinical application due to the inability to account for covariate(s) that affect the dependence structure of the variables being investigated. A common method is to adjust the effect of the covariates via a linear model and work with the resulting residuals. However, removing the effects of the covariates could potentially eliminate valuable information from the analysis. We propose a functional nonparametric covariance matrix estimator to account for any given value in the covariate(s), which allows a comparison of the functional covariance structures of the multivariate data. This comparison is facilitated via a test statistic involving the first eigenvalue of the combined form of covariance matrices of the two groups. Three different approaches, namely, the parametric Tracy-Widom, the semi-parametric Forkman's test, and the nonparametric Permutation method, are used to compute the approximate p-values of the test statistic. We have conducted extensive simulation studies to determine the type I error and power of the proposed hypothesis testing methods and developed practical recommendations for implementing this novel approach. Finally, we apply our methods to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study to compare cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers between dementia and non-dementia cohorts, which offers a fascinating insight into the differences between covariance structures of biomarkers amyloid β(1 - 42)(Aβ42) , total tau (tau), and phosphorylated tau (ptau) for given values of age, sex, and years of education.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and dementia commonly co-occur and pose significant challenges to public health, particularly in aging populations. While the heightened risk of stroke in AF undoubtedly contributes to neurocognitive injury, accumulating evidence suggests that stroke alone does not explain the full extent of cognitive decline in individuals with AF. Shared risk factors such as advancing age, hypertension, and diabetes, as well as pathophysiological mechanisms that include silent cerebral infarcts, chronic hypoperfusion, inflammatory pathways, and cerebral microbleeds, appear to drive this multifaceted relationship. Increasing data from observational cohorts, randomized trials, and meta-analyses underscore the potential benefits of anticoagulation, rhythm control, and lifestyle interventions in mitigating these neurocognitive risks, though notable gaps in research remain. This review provides a comprehensive examination of the epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and current therapeutic strategies for AF-related cognitive impairment. By evaluating emerging evidence-including data on anticoagulation timing, AF ablation, and cognitive screening-we highlight critical areas in need of further investigation to inform clinical practice and improve outcomes for this vulnerable population.

BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of people require evaluation for possible dementia. However, research on the accuracy of informant questionnaires in primary care remains limited. METHODS: This study assessed the diagnostic accuracy of IQCODE, AD8, and GPCOGi based on the informant's relationship to the patient. We recruited 240 participants from 21 general practices in South West England. The reference standard for a diagnosis of dementia was made by a specialist clinician using ICD-10 criteria. A threshold of greater than 3.3 on IQCODE, greater or equal to 2 on AD8 and less than 5 on the informant component of GPCOG was used to indicate an abnormal test. RESULTS: Of 238 participants with informant data, 131 had dementia, 60 had CIND, and 47 had normal cognition. Median informant age was 70 years (IQR 60 years to 78 years). 71% of informants were female and 56% were spouses. On all three questionnaires, compared to spouses, adult descendants tended to score participants more cognitively impaired, whereas friends scored participants less cognitively impaired. However, there was little evidence of difference by informant type once fully adjusted. Sensitivity by informant type ranged from 91 to 100% for IQCODE, 94-100% for AD8 and 99% to100% for GPCOGi. There was no significant difference in sensitivity by informant type. Specificity by informant type ranged from 25 to 79% for IQCODE, 13-75% for AD8 and 17-38% for GPCOGi. Adult descendants tended to have the lowest specificity at 25% (95% CI 10-47%) for IQCODE, 13% (95% CI 3-32%) for AD8 and 17% (95% CI 5-37%) for GPCOGi. Friends tended to have the highest specificity at 79% (95% CI 49-95%) for IQCODE, 75% (95% CI 48-93%) for AD8 and 38% (95% CI 15-64%) for GPCOGi. CONCLUSIONS: An informant of any relationship type, using IQCODE, AD8 or GPCOGi may be useful for ruling out dementia but not for ruling it in. We found no evidence of difference between spouse or adult descendants but friends performed significantly better overall on IQCODE and AD8.

BACKGROUND: The development of the Richmond Brain Health Initiative (RBHI) was guided by the need to address local brain health service gaps to improve Alzheimer's/Dementia health disparities in racially diverse communities. This paper describes the establishment of RBHI through 1) community and provider stakeholder input and 2) community brain health screening/intake development and testing. METHODS: Phase 1 involved provider and community stakeholder questionnaires to gather feedback as part of the Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle. Subsequently, stakeholder findings directed the RBHI structure and screening/intake registration testing in the community. RESULTS: Based on the stakeholder responses from fifteen providers and twenty community members, there was strong consensus in the need for local brain health services. The most highly recommended screening needs were for caregiving, cognitive status, and lifestyle risks. Thereafter the RBHI screening/intake was developed and completed by 45 community participants. Participants showed hypertension (62%) as the most prevalent brain health risk factor, followed by depression/anxiety (56%), and loneliness (44%). The intake also indicated cognitive and functional deficits, with the Montreal Cognitive mean equaling 18.4 and the Functional Activities mean equaling 14.9. Additionally, 73% of participants reported experiencing subjective cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: This study showcases a model for promoting brain health in racially diverse communities to improve access to Alzheimer's disease and related dementia resources and services.
